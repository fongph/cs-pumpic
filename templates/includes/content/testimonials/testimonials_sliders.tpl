                        <p>“With Pumpic I’m sure my child won’t get in touch with strangers online. I use the app to block websites that are too explicit for the underage, control what she writes and reads on Facebook, and monitor her phone activities. I’m a lone parent and can count only on my own. Pumpic helps me very much with it. Thanks for keeping my child safer.”</p>

                        <p>“I needed a tool to control my child’s cell. He hangs on the phone all the time and I’ve realized I must limit it somehow. I searched online and found Pumpic recommended as a reliable solution for tracking activities on kids’ mobile gadgets. I set it up on my child’s phone and now can see how many time he uses it for talking, Internet surfing, game playing etc. Nice app! Thanks! I’d recommend it to each parent.”</p>

                        <p>“Every parent should understand how dangerous online reality is for a child. There are too many inappropriate things posted and it’s so easy for a child to access it all. I use Pumpic on my boy’s phone to put some restrictions on what he is not supposed to see yet. I don’t want to deprive him of online access as such. But I want him to be safe. And Pumpic helps me a lot with it.”</p>
