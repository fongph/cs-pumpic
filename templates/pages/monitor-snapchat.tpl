        <p>Snapchat is a multimedia messaging mobile application, often referred to as yet another social network. However, unlike other popular social media, your posts (or snaps) don’t stay available for viewing for a long time. Snaps can be up to 10 seconds in duration and disappear once they’re opened. There are also “stories” that stick around for 24 hours before vanishing.</p> 
	    <p>Today, Snapchat is among the top 13 US apps downloaded overall and oftentimes a top 3 app for most downloaded US photo and video app. And it’s extremely popular among kids (some researchers say even more popular than Facebook) that makes it essential for their parents to keep an eye on their young ones’ Snapchat communication activities.</p>

        <p>As you can see, many teens love Snapchat simply because they consider it as a mean of carrying on private conversations escaping “unnecessary” parents’ attention. Generally, kids use it to exchange jokes, funny pictures and videos without commonly adopted feedback similar to Facebook “likes” or comments.</p>
		<p>At the same time, Snapchat’s peculiar feature of photos and videos that vanish in a matter of seconds makes the app an opportune tool for online predators and pedophiles. That’s why having Snapchat monitoring software installed on kids’ mobile devices is what every concerned parent should do.</p>

        {*<p>Using monitoring software to protect kids is an urgent issue of contemporary society.
        On one hand, technological progress opened new doors for the evolution of humanity; on the other one, it has
        resulted in a lot of dangers in return. And children are exposed to these dangers much more than others.</p>
        <ul>
		    <li>72% of children worldwide use smartphones, 33% of them are under 8 years old</li>
            <li>23% of teenagers report that they feel addicted to games on mobile devices</li>
            <li>69% of boys and girls under 18 have experienced cyberbullying via mobile phones</li>
		</ul>
        <p>As a parent you should always keep the situation under control, be aware of possible threats coming from the Internet,
        how to resist it, and if a reliable Android parental monitoring app can be the way out:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>control cell phone usage</li>
            <li>follow online activity</li>
            <li>track routes and location</li>
        </ul>*}

    <p>In Snapchat, short ”snaps” (2-10 seconds) are quickly deleted after the user looked them through, and there’s no log of their correspondence. This makes many teens feel that interactions in Snapchat are “safe” and they may send pictures and messages that they would not otherwise send if their activity could be tracked. These are the most important reasons why following kids’ Snapchat activity must be practiced:</p>
    <ul class="list-images">
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/monitor-snapchat_bullet1.png" alt="Sexting. Explicit Content" class="lc-3" /><strong>Sexting.</strong> To prevent sexting, that is sending sexually explicit messages and pictures. The issue is of particular importance because over one-third of Snapchat users are under the age of 18, and online predators try to take advantage of it. By pretending to be somebody they aren't, they gain kids' confidence in an underhand way.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/monitor-snapchat_bullet2.png" alt="Cyberbullying" class="lc-2" /><strong>Cyberbullies.</strong> To avert cyberbullies who enjoy the feeling of impunity for sending hateful messages to their victims because there is no “trail” of their actions. Cyberbullying is one of the most troublesome consequences of using social media or online messengers that is extremely difficult for parents to identify and address to. According to Cybersmile Foundation poll, 55% of children suffer online bullying.</li>        
    </ul>
	<p></p>
    <p>These reasons are reinforced by the lack of moderation in Snapchat. We’re talking about the fact that inappropriate messages can be sent to your kids by anybody, not just people from their friend list. This means parents may even not have an idea who their kids are talking to.</p>

He started acting weirdly like a half year ago, and my conversations with him didn’t help to figure out what’s going on. A colleague told me about Pumpic; she was totally satisfied with it, so I haven’t even looked for any alternative. Due to tracking my son’s interactions on Facebook and Snapchat, I discovered that two older guys from school inveigled him into bullying a girl from his class. Good that we dealt with this situation before it has got too far.”</p>

                                    <p>“Pumpic is just what I was looking for. My daughter is a social media addict. As well as all her friends, though. Many parental monitoring apps let you track SMS or location, but just a few let you monitor multiple social networks. Pumpic does. Because this service deletes messages after they’re opened, I wasn’t able to track who my girl is communicating with and about what. I don’t want to get into embarrassing details, but thanks to monitoring, I managed to stop her inappropriate correspondence with some guy pretending to be a 17-year-old girl.”</p>

                                    <p>“I like Pumpic more and more each day because it makes my life a lot easier. I did my best to raise my son as a responsible and trustworthy person. But there’s a huge difference between hoping that he really thinks about what he’s doing and possible consequences of his actions – and knowing it for sure. Before I adopted Pumpic, I was just hoping everything’s ok. But now I do know that my son is not involved in any inappropriate activity. I have peace of mind now and believe he’s gonna live a decent life.”</p>
