        <p class="text-center f-light">Cyberbullying, online predator attacks, and sexting are Internet dangers children face world-widely each day. In fact, Australia is the third most searching country on the cyberbullying topic. More often than not parents know too little about what actually is going on with their kids online and even less about how to secure them. Sometimes such ignorance costs children lives.</p>

Thus, kids and their parents can ask the government to remove humiliating content by making a formal complaint. If a network refuses to remove a harmful post, it is charged $17,000 fine for each day such content remains on the site.</p>
                <p>The weakest point of the program is that most children refuse to inform parents about cyberbullying. They are simply afraid of abusers so much that will never tell anyone about it. Statistically, only 1 in 3 kids inform adults about being bellied online.</p>
