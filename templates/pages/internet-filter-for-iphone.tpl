	<p>Hardly can anyone argue that digital technology has become today central to teens’ lives with the Internet activity being one of its main elements. And handheld devices became a passway to the online world as teens are almost inseparable with their Internet-connected smartphones and tablets. No doubt, the World Wide Web is an inexhaustible source of knowledge; but at the same time, it is a place where many perils lie in wait for careless users. Pornography, gambling, sects, hateful speech, sexual predators – this list of online dangers is far from being full.</p>
	<p>Of course, parents try to monitor their kids’ digital interactions, but they mostly take a hands-on approach to checking child’s phone or tablet manually. Using digital tools like parental controls or cell phone filter software is not a widespread practice. This results in the fact that parents don’t have a complete understanding of what is going on in their kids’ lives and whether they need help.</p>

        <p>When parents check up kids’ mobile devices manually and manage to find traces of inappropriate online activity, they respond to the problem. However, it is commonly accepted that preventing issues from happening is a better option than reacting to their consequences. Installing content filtering apps is one of the most effective ways to avert troubles that originate from the Internet use. That’s why choosing and utilizing the reliable Internet filters for smartphone your kid owns is what every concerned parent should do.</p>

	    <p class="text-center f-light">Having an iPhone is a sacred dream of many kids and teenagers. Apple, Inc. is so good at marketing its products to the younger generation that 74% of teens want their next phone to be specifically an iPhone (according to investment bank Piper Jaffray survey conducted in October 2015). So if you – as a parent – decide to fulfill your kid’s dream, be sure to take care of some precaution measures that will protect your little ones from online perils mentioned above by setting up content filters for iPhone with the help of built-in tools or additional software.</p>

                        <p>‘Restrictions’ are Apple’s branded built-in parental controls. It can be quite effectively used for blocking or filtering things like adult-themed materials, games, social media and other applications. With ‘Restrictions’, parents can also monitor their kids’ calls, SMS, contacts, calendar as well as track GPS location and view route history. Yet, like almost any onboard software, ‘Restrictions’ have limited functionality, and it is, in fact, pretty easy for a tech-savvy teen to work around them.</p>

                        <p>Another option is to spend some buck and pick a standalone parental control mobile app - a comprehensive software that among other things includes content filtering. Apart from this, such applications can also monitor calls and SMS (even deleted ones), keep track of social media and online chats, show browsing history and contacts, access emails and multimedia files as well as track kid’s whereabouts via GPS. One of parental control apps’ advantages is that a child cannot override it.</p>

        <p class="text-center f-light">There is a wide choice of technology-based means to control your kid’s digital activity, no problem with that. But you as a parent must remember that no Internet filter app for iPhone can replace parental guidance and example. Open and honest communication between parent and child still remain the most efficient tool to establish a trustworthy relationship. Hence, arranging regular talks with your little one about the essentials of the Internet etiquette and safety will protect him or her from online hazards better than any firewall.</p>
