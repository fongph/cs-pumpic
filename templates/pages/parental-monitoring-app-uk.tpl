                                    <p>“I tried so hard to teach my daughter to discipline, but she refused to study and spent almost all her spare time playing mobile games, talking on the phone and messaging her so-called friends on the Internet. I realized that I needed a tool to control her things to do. I searched online and came across Pumpic in a review article. It turned out to be a really useful and helpful app. It lets me control all kinds of activities on my daughters’ smartphone and block them if needed. First, she tried to stand against my interference, but soon started to improve and admit her mistakes. Thanks Pumpic for helping me with parenting and protecting my family.”</p>

I worried about my son and didn’t want him to fall into bad company. That’s why I bought Pumpic and installed it on his iPhone. I now have no worries at all as even when I’m away on business I know exactly what my son is up to and what he does. The app allows me to track calls, messages, look through his online activities and, which is most important, monitor his chats. Say, last weekend I checked his Skype and found out that he was going to visit a concert I had put under ban previously. Great app, be sure.”</p>

This spring, when we took a guided tour to London, my eldest son got lost at Piccadilly Circus. I couldn’t reach him on the phone, so I used the app and it showed me where he was. When at work, I monitor who calls my kids and whom they call, I check websites they visit and has blocked some of them already. My favorite function is geo-fencing. It lets me know exactly when they come back from school, go to visit a granny, and if they go anywhere without my permission. I would recommend Pumpic to all parents.”</p>
