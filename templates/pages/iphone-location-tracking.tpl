Hence, in order to avoid or just to keep down these threats, an essential solution of using special software for location monitoring speaks for itself.</p>

    <p>Often, to monitor the location of a child, you must get an extra gadget, like GPS watch or bracelet. Pumpic doesn’t depend on any additional devices, but the sole smartphone. A parent simply installs the app on the target device and checks the location data whenever necessary in the Control Panel via the web interface or designated app. It is very handy when a kid goes on a trip with friends, has a bus or car ride, or intends a journey into the wild.</p>
	<p>When it comes to GPS monitoring, we offer a range of features for precise and innovative location tracking. Using them, parents can rest assured that their kids are staying on track and don’t stray from the expected safe route. Pumpic <a class="a-default" href="/tracking-app-for-iphone.html">tracking app for iPhone</a> boasts a number of valuable features and options that give its users a peace of mind and up-to-date information regarding kids’ whereabouts:</p>
    <ul class="list-images">
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/iphone-location-tracking_icon1.png" title="Current location tracking" alt="Track your kid's location at any given moment" class="lc-3" /><p><strong>Current location tracking.</strong></p>
		<p>With our app, it is possible to live-track the child’s location around-the-clock. It doesn't matter which iOS device a kid possesses, the app will pull out the location of the mobile phone and instantly display it in the Control Panel.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/iphone-location-tracking_icon2.png" title="Routes history" alt="View full routes and locations history" class="lc-2" /><p><strong>Routes history.</strong></p>
		<p>The app pinpoints the location of a device over a certain time for visual representation of a child’s route and visited landmarks. This feature is as well available for non-jailbroken Apple devices.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/iphone-location-tracking_icon3.png" title="Setting geo-fences" alt="Set geofences and receive alerts" class="lc-3" /><p><strong>Setting geo-fences.</strong></p>
		<p>Geo-fencing puts a lot of worries to rest. With this helpful option, a parent is enabled to set a safe zone or a dangerous community boundaries on the map. Thus, whenever a kid leaves or enters the pre-set boundaries, Pumpic sends an alert to the parent so that he can take measures if needed.</p></li>
    </ul>
	<p>iPhone GPS tracking should be within access for every parent since iOS devices are widely spread among young ones. With the rise of mobile gadgets and GPS technologies, it had become much easier and more convenient to keep track of child’s precise whereabouts and prevent undesired situations. Eventually, by providing unmatched kids’ location monitoring features, Pumpic brings parents peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is crucial for parents to remember that over-involvement in kids’ life and a rigorous eye on them may lead to adversarial relationships. Indeed, parents are fully authorized and obliged to take care of their underage children. At the same time, before starting to monitor a child, we recommend to have a talk with your kids and notify them of your intentions. It is important to explain the security reasons for tracking so that a kid doesn’t start to rebel; on the contrary, you should show that he/she is cared for.</p>

			<p>Today, there are many solutions available for location tracking. They include specific hardware for vehicles, GPS navigators and trackers, gadgets for people monitoring, etc. Notwithstanding these solutions, a parental control software is the most convenient and comforting solution for people who worry about their close ones. A parental monitoring is <strong>very easy to install and set up</strong> on smartphones. Moreover, it doesn’t require any additional devices or hook-ups. Just install an iPhone GPS tracker app and get a sense of safety for both yourself and your kids.</p>
			<p>To use the app, you are not required to have profound technical skills at all. Once installed on a kids’ device, the monitoring software starts collecting information from it and send to the personal account of a parent. Besides, in addition to location oversight, parental control apps are enriched with features for monitoring messages, browser history, calls information, photos and videos, and the device activity altogether.</p>
			<p>Parental control applications are <strong>100% legal</strong> since designed to monitor kids via devices that belong to concerned parents. Such software can also be used to track employees (phones must be owned by the employer). To avoid misunderstanding between the one who monitors and the target person, it is advised to notify the person of monitoring purposes. Communication is crucial in this regards, especially with kids who strive to individuate and build their own world. Being overprotective may negatively affect the relationships between kids and parents.</p>
