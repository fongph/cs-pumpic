	<p>The time minors spend using digital media has ballooned over the recent years. As reported by the CNN, average time a teen or tween spends daily in front of a screen has reached a scandalous number of 9 hours. And in case you are about to turn off your TV as a proof of your good parenting skills, hang on a moment and rethink your impulsive decision. The study also shows that children spend only 1 hour a day in front of that particular screen. The rest is spent on their smartphones and tablets, damaging their eyesight and exposing them to many dangers on the Internet.</p>

        <p>It's natural that you would like to cut that time by half at least and protect your kids’ lives. However, child safety is not only about the amount of time they spend using screen media, but also about what they do in their digital world.</p>
		<p>Can I restrict time kids spend playing video games? Is their communication appropriate? And how do I block texts on Android or <a class="a-default" href="/best-internet-filter-for-android.html">filter content</a> if they happen to be explicit? In addition to showing you the exact location of your kid, the Pumpic mobile monitoring app  answers your numerous questions and allows you to control the target device usage in various possible ways.</p>

            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>It's time to face it, 9 hours in front of screen media definitely beats those few hours you have face to face with your kid daily. In the modern world, where 67% of teens own a smartphone, 53% of tweens possess their own tablet, there is no way you can watch over you children without a mobile monitoring app.</p>
				<p>Although most devices have some built-in functions to track location and limit phone usage, it's clearly not enough to shield our dear ones from cyberbullying, which is known to be a major reason of teenage suicides. The same goes for explicit web content, which can harm their psychological development.</p>
				<p>Parents usually try to control web content on devices, but often overlook different ways of communication: Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Viber, Kik, Skype, and <a class="a-default" href="/sms-monitoring-software.html">text messaging (SMS, MMS)</a>. Skimming through messages might be a bit too late. Some of the messages should be never seen. Therefore, here what you can prevent once you learn how to block messages on an Android phone.</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Cyberbullying. You take your son or daughter away from a bad company of bullies into a safe place called home. But then he or she becomes an easy target of cyberbullies through the phone and different messengers.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Online predators. They search for vulnerable teenagers online, but can reach them through texts later on. And even if a child wants to put an end to such communication, he or she doesn’t know how and is ashamed to ask for help when it’s gone too far.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Identity theft. Teens may text some innocent common things to a new friend or a stranger. However, that information in wrong hands can facilitate child’s identity theft, which is reported to become a fairly common crime nowadays.</li>
				<p>Although your children spend more time looking at their screens and texting than listening to you, don't disregard the importance of an honest talk with a minor about probable dangers in both real and digital worlds.</p>

Teenagers don't share all their problems with parents, but I just wanted to make sure everything is fine in his life. I've learned about Pumpic from a friend of mine.

She sometimes accidentally changes some settings in the phone, so I decided to prevent some other accidental and inappropriate discoveries by installing Pumpic. Cause, you know, an innocent search online can result in really explicit content. So, I block potential harm like links to 18+ sites and games. And besides, I teach her a great deal of time management, restricting how long she plays Angry Birds and watches cartoons. I allow her to doodle as much as she wants, though.”</p>
