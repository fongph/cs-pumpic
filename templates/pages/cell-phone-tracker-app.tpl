	<p>Nowadays, virtually all smartphones come equipped with GPS sensors. The possibility to track someone's cell phone opens up huge new opportunities both for service providers and for consumers. For example, advertisers can demonstrate you relevant announcements and promotions based on your current location. In turn, smartphone and tablet users can navigate while driving or walking. Also, when you're able to see your position on a map in real time, you can spot and assess stores, restaurants or other points of interest located nearby. People, who are into sports, are enabled to track, analyze, and store their workout data.</p>
	<p>Moreover, today there are plenty of social networks built around mobile devices' location tracking capabilities. FourSquare, Glympse, Yik Yak, MeetMe and others are very popular among kids and teenagers. Even the fact that they may reveal user's current position to many complete strangers doesn't stop people from actively exploiting these apps.</p>
	<p>Another trend to utilize smartphones' GPS features is to locate family members in real time. For parents, who strive to protect their kids from stranger danger, abduction, and other perils, this is a real catch.</p>

        <p>For parents, knowing where their kid is and that he or she is OK is simply priceless. Tracking child's mobile device is arguably the best way to figure out his or her location. The thing is modern-day teens are almost inseparable with their gadgets and have them around 24/7. Therefore, having located the phone or tablet, you will with 99,9% probability locate the kid as well. Also, this is the easiest way to find lost or stolen gadget.</p>
		<p>However, as the statistics show, surprisingly few parents take advantage of using parental tracking software. Maybe it's because the dispute over ethic and privacy aspects of tracking children is still a hot topic. On the other hand, this debate is not in the way for 53% of parents who use some sort of parental controls to monitor and even manage the Internet use by their children. Anyway, for caring parents, it would be at least useful to know how they can make the most out of cell phone tracking.</p>

    title="Best Phone Tracking App Enhanced with Plenty Monitoring Features"

    <p>Reliable GPS tracking functionality is one of the most prominent features of Pumpic parental monitoring app. Whether you need to check your kid's current location, verify that he/she accurately attends extracurricular activities or review routes history – Pumpic can provide this information with ease. Thus, the app helps parents be virtually around their kid even if they actually are miles away. This lets parents have peace of mind and even prevent possible wrongdoings by their children. From this perspective, it would be good to know that teenagers commit over 70% of juvenile crimes at times when they should have been in another place, like school or sports training.</p>
	<p>Pumpic works with both most popular mobile operating systems – iOS and Android. For Apple devices, there are two solutions – without (iCloud monitoring) and with jailbreak. For Android, there is a single solution, which has a great geofencing feature. With activated GPS location tracker, Android solution allows adults set safe zones or restricted areas on the map. Once a child crosses the borders of such sector, a parent gets a notification about it.</p>
	<p>Let's have a closer look at Pumpic solutions and their location tracking capabilities:</p>
    <ul class="list-images">
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/cell-phone-tracker-app_icloud.png" title="Jailbreak-free iOS current location tracking" alt="Track your kid's position at any moment you wish" class="lc-3" /><p>With <strong>iOS (iCloud) solution</strong>, you are enabled to track location in real-time, request location at any moment, and view the entire location history. Due to Apple devices and iCloud peculiarities, geofences feature is not available for jailbreak-free monitoring. You can check out Control Panel DEMO of the iCloud solution <a class="a-default" href="{$schema}demo.pumpic.com/setDevice/126?redirect_url=cp/locations#_ga=1.176328805.111115145.1467266242">here</a></p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/cell-phone-tracker-app_ios.png" title="Jailbreak iOS current location tracking" alt="View routes and whereabouts history" class="lc-2" /><p>The <strong>solution for the jailbroken iOS</strong> offers real-time location tracking, request location feature, and location history. Geofences feature is currently available for iOS up to 9.1 as currently there is no proved jailbreak release for the latest iOS 10. You can check out Control Panel DEMO of the iOS jailbreak solution <a class="a-default" href="{$schema}demo.pumpic.com/setDevice/5059?redirect_url=cp/locations#_ga=1.176328805.111115145.1467266242">here</a>.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/cell-phone-tracker-app_android.png" title="Android current location tracking" alt="Track location, set geofences and receive alerts" class="lc-3" /><p>The <strong>Android solution</strong> utilizes the same features as iOS – real-time location tracking, request location feature, location history. Plus it supports setting geofences. And you don't even need to root your Android device (however, root is required for some other monitoring features). You can check out Control Panel DEMO of the Android solution <a class="a-default" href="{$schema}demo.pumpic.com/setDevice/125?redirect_url=cp/locations#_ga=1.176328805.111115145.1467266242">here</a>.</p></li>

	<p>There are several cases in the US when parental mobile apps helped parents find missing children. For example, couple years ago in Georgia such software on a minor's smartphone became a critical factor in locating an abducted boy. His mother reviewed the log of boy’s routes and places he had visited before a SIM card was removed from his phone. She passed this data to the police; then, it took only a few hours to find the child and bring him back to his mom.</p>
    <p>With every year, GPS-enabled gadgets play increasingly important role in our lives. With the activated GPS tracking app, iPhone or Android device can provide valuable services and peace of mind for parents. An additional benefit of using a smartphone to keep tabs on kids' whereabouts is that you don't need to buy a new separate gadget. Parents can track locations and routes right from their smartphone or through any browser on a computer with an Internet connection. Yet, Pumpic is much more than just a GPS tracking tool. It is a comprehensive parental mobile app with a broad range of monitoring features to ensure all-round protection for your little ones.</p>
