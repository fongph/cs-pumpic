            <h2>Simple Reasons for Installing Android Child Tracking App</h2>
            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <img class="img-align-right" alt="android app for tracking phone" src="{$img}/landings/android-kid-monitoring.png" width="207px" height="208px" />
                <p>With the significant amount of time every child spends on the Internet via a mobile device the need for control is becoming urgent. Thankfully, there are lots of monitoring apps to help us with kids’ security, including the ones <a class="a-default" href="/android-parental-monitoring.html">for Android platform</a>.</p>
				<p>There are three main reasons to choose a reliable Android parental control app for your child’s safety:</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is legal – such software is allowed for usage by parents towards their underage children, and unlike with spy programs you will have no troubles here.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is convenient – an Android app for tracking a phone is installed on the device only once and will watch over your kid’s activities until you stop it yourself.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is multifunctional – according to surveys, 8-18 year-olds devote an average of 7 hours to social media. If you are teaching your child about responsible behavior online, cell phone tracking software for Android would be additional way to see if your kid is following your advice.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>At the same time, you will always know where your kid is and what he or she is doing. Android mobile tracking software will help prevent your children from meeting strangers or falling a victim for cyberbullying.</p>
				<p>However, parents should always remember that parental control software should be an additional plan, and you should always teach kids about rules of behavior first talking to them.</p>

    <p>According to Pew Research Center, many parents agree that it is important to know what children do on the Internet. To ensure online safety, many of them use various methods for controlling kids’ activities, namely Android phone tracking software allowing them to follow every step a child takes while surfing the World Wide Web. And it is even more essential to talk to kids and teach them safe behavior on smartphone and tablets.</p>
    <p>Mobile tracking software designed for Android devices is a powerful tool that can protect children and let parents avert many dangers before any trouble has happened. Let’s take a closer look at what parental controls can do for you as a careful parent.</p>
	<ul class="list-images list-images-second">
        <li><img src="{$img}/landings/android-child-tracking.png" alt="child with smartphone" class="lc-3" />First of all, let’s consider cell phone use. Talking on the phone with strangers as well as text communication are potential risks children can be exposed to. A reliable Android app for tracking your kid’s phone will show you who calls them or writes SMS. And as soon as you see that any misbehavior happens, you can intervene and stop the danger.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/landings/android-parental-monitoring.png" alt="kid internet activity" class="lc-3" />Internet activity is another major risk. Cyberbullying keeps taking children’s lives away. Meanwhile, online predators seek for an opportunity to attack and abuse kids, who use online media irresponsibly. Tracking software reveals communication on social media to parents and let them keep an eye on online friends and strangers that may contact children.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/landings/android-locator.png" alt="locating kids" class="lc-3" />Parents worry, when children go anywhere alone. Especially, when you don’t know for sure where they go. An Android <a class="a-default" href="http://pumpic.com/how-to-trace-cell-phones.html" target="blank">cell phone locator</a> tracks smartphones and tablets remotely showing exact whereabouts and route history. In addition, there is an option to set geo-fences and receive notifications, when kids leave or enter some specific areas. Thus, you can point ‘home’ or ‘school’ as safety zone and see, when a child comes back or leaves.</li>
        <li style="margin-top: 45px!important;"><img src="{$img}/landings/android-app-block-distractions.png" alt="restrict mobile activities" class="lc-3-last" />Moreover, parental controls like Pumpic allow parents to restrict some activities on mobile phones and even block the target device, until children deserve to use it. Thus, you can block a phone for bedtime or when your kids do their homework so as to not distract them from what is important.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Another important issue is selecting a reliable parental control app. E.g. Pumpic is recognized by TopTenReviews as one of the best Android tracking software. At the same time, it is trusted by more than 10,000 customers all over the world. It mean that parents can rest assured that their children are safe, while Pumpic is installed on their devices. The app provides comprehensive control over what is going on with your little loved ones, when you are not nearby.</p>
