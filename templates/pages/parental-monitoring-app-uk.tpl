                <p>Cyberbullying is one of the most crucial online issues children face world-widely. Some parents simply don’t realize how important is Internet security these days. Many of them ignore safety rules and forget to teach kids secure behavior before letting them enter the Internet. Meanwhile sometimes it costs children lives.</p>

                <p>Child online safety is an urgent international issue. That’s why many developed countries as well as the United Kingdom try to take Internet danger under control by all possible means warning children against threats they may encounter on the web. Thus, the UK Council for Child Internet Safety stands on guard of child online security comprising government, law, industry, academia, and charity sectors.</p>
                <p>However, it turns out to be not enough to provide kids with all-round protection. That’s why the government encourages families to teach kids, explain the importance of safe online behavior, and apply parental control every time children access networks. This and even more is now possible thanks to parental monitoring software available in the UK.</p>

And it went far beyond my expectations. In addition to standard GPS and online activity tracking, the app allows monitoring calls, SMS, setting geo-fences, and includes many other useful functions. Strongly recommend!”</p>

                                        <p>“I didn’t realize how dangerous the Internet might be for kids, until my 12-year-old son became a victim of a bully. An older boy teased him at school and as it turned out sent threatening messages on Facebook. Thanks God my wife took advice of her friend and installed Pumpic on our son’s smartphone. We talked all things out with parents of the bully and he finally left my boy alone. I keep an eye on my son every day. With call monitoring software like Pumpic I’m sure I can protect him.”</p>

                                        <p>“I started thinking over a child tracker as soon as we moved to the UK. I’ve read many articles about online predators, who hunt kids on social networks and attack when parents aren’t at home. Our new neighbors recommended Pumpic as a good and tested safety app for kids. And it went far beyond my expectations. In addition to standard GPS and online activity tracking, the app allows monitoring calls, SMS, setting geo-fences, and includes many other useful functions. Strongly recommend!”</p>

I work online and see how many inappropriate things there are in the free stream. With Pumpic, I’m sure my girl won’t visit 18+ web sources, that no one will hurt her, and she will not talk to strangers. I can’t easily block unknown phone numbers and view each SMS she receives. She’s only 12 and I’m completely responsible for her safety. And Pumpic does a great job helping me with it.”</p>

I know how many dangers there are online and I don’t want my girl to come across any of them. I check her Facebook communication, view what she posts on Instagram as well as her friends’ comments. With Pumpic I can be sure she won’t hang out with a bad company and check places she visits when goes out with friends. I’d recommend such a kid tracker to all parents in the UK who really care.”</p>
