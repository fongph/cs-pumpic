	<img class="app-icon-left" src="{$img}/landings/icon-spyapps-for-android.png" alt="Spy on Android Phones">
	<p>Due to the survey data from the Pew Research Center, 92% of U.S. adults own a cellphone, 73% have a computer and 45% own a tablet. Obviously, it makes the software providers compete really fierce to present more advanced options for monitoring.</p>
	<p>However, you should understand the difference between spy apps and parental monitoring apps like Pumpic. When the first ”mobile spies” came out, they were advertised like “Catch a cheating spouse!” Today, with the help of such apps, it is possible to monitor almost all activities, which take place on a cell phone or tablet. Spy software for Android traces SMS, Skype, Facebook, Snapchat, GPS location, browsing history, and much more in a stealth mode and illegal way.</p>
	<p>On the contrary, parental control apps like Pumpic serve to protect children from inappropriate information. Do you know that about a third of parents use parental controls on their teens’ cell phones? Parents of younger teens (age 12-13) are most likely to restrict their children’s phone use.</p>

        <p>There are many companies providing you with an opportunity to secretly view remote activities of another person. You can check a list of the <a href="/best-spying-apps-for-android.html">best spying apps&nbsp;for Android</a> to know more about tracking apps and their features. The most know among them are mSpy, Mobile Spy, SpyEra, Phone Tracker, and MobiStealth. By the way, SMS spy is the most widespread kind of spying. SMS tracking apps allow monitoring incoming, outgoing, and even deleted messages.</p>
		<p>However, you should note that it is against the laws of most countries to spy on someone's device. Do doubt, it is illegal and unethical to use even the best spy app for Android. Some advertisements make people believe that monitoring text messages and checking phone calls is normal, but in fact, it ignores legal requirements.</p>

            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>According to the Pew Research Center, parents monitor their children’s digital behavior in a number of ways. Discussing acceptable online behavior with teens and checking their social profiles isn't enough. That's why using parental monitoring software is a smart way to keep your child safe on the Internet.</p>
				<p>Here are five main reasons to set up parental control app like Pumpic:</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>It has diverse functions – some of the most useful protection measures are monitoring calls, text messages, online activities, blocking apps, websites as well as all inappropriate links.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>It is legal – parental controls are absolutely legal to use, unlike spying programs for Android. Monitoring software is allowed and you won't have any problems.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Is it easy to use – a tracking app can be easily installed and you can monitor your child with the help of a simple Control Panel.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>It is convenient – you can monitor your kid's activities remotely from any browser and any device.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>It can prevent unacceptable online behavior and many dangers (cyberbullying, online predator attacks, sexting, identity theft etc.) </li>
				<p>Keep in mind that to install a tracking app, you need to ensure that you own the target device or have obtained the owner's permission for monitoring.</p>
