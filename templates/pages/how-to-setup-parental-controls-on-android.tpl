            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>Installing parental control software on Android devices may seem challenging for those, who do it for the very first time. Sure, there may be some tricky nuances. Monitoring applications differ from ordinary apps due to specific functionality. However, there is nothing complicated at all and you will understand it quickly as soon as you read a brief step-by-step explanation below.</p>
				<ul class="parental-controls">
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-1.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />The place to start with is selecting a reliable monitoring app for Android as well as a subscription plan that will fit your monitoring requirements and budget. If you choose Pumpic, for example, you will get over 24 features with the Premium plan for only $6.99 per month. At the same time, the Basic subscription will cost you $5.33 per month showing the same great performance, thought with a little less features.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-2.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />The next step is assigning your child’s smartphone or tablet to your subscription plan. Here you will need to enter your personal account or Control Panel and add the target device to which the monitoring features within your subscription plan will be applied. Note that you can apply your subscription to only one device. Right after the target device will be connected to your subscription, you will be able to move on and install <a class="a-default" href="/android-parental-monitoring.html">monitoring software</a> on your child’s Android gadget.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-3.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />Now take the target device in hands. Yes, physical access if required to perform further setup. A monitoring app must be installed directly on a smartphone or tablet that you are going to keep track of. Don’t worry it won’t take you long. Meanwhile, a step-by-step guide is provided with your subscription email right after your purchase.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-4.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />You should know that some advanced features of parental control software like monitoring social media, online chats, emails etc. require rooting. That’s why if you want to use all the variety of available parental control solutions, you will need to root your kid’s smartphone or tablet before installing a monitoring app on it. Rooting is a quick and easy process and you will surely have no problems with it, if you follow provided guidelines attentively.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-5.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />When all of the aforementioned steps are successfully performed, you can proceed and install a monitoring application on the target device. This process usually takes up to five minutes. Meanwhile all guidelines on how to setup parental controls on Android are provided with your subscription email. Just in case, if you suddenly face any difficulties you can turn to Customer Care Team at any time and get qualified assistance on any question.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/put-parental-controls-on-android/how-to-put-parental-controls-on-android-phone-6.png" alt="How to Set Parental Controls on Android" class="lc-1" />Now it’s time to start monitoring and protecting your loved ones. Enter your Control Panel. All the data from the target device will be transferred there soon after the setup. In your Control Panel, you will be able to check call logs, sent and received text messages, track location, and monitor online use. In addition, you can manipulate the target device remotely by setting restrictions, blocking certain activities etc.</li>
				</ul>
