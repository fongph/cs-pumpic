<p>Typically, the majority of parents are happier than childless people, according to research by Katherine Nelson, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Psychology at Sewanee: The University of the South. But let's admit it: even for those parents whose 'load' is relatively light, parenting is very often stressful. For some people, stress starts even before getting pregnant due to reproductive issues. Classically, legends are spoken about tense times during pregnancy. After a baby is born, a total change of a daily – and nightly! – routine tests the limits of every woman and man. As the kid grows, the issue of disciple emerges. Many parents hope that with time (or at a certain child's age), stress will drastically decrease or even end. But this is a misconception; it has been well said that little children – little worries, big children – big worries. And being worried about the safety of your offspring becomes probably even more stressful with each passing year.</p>
<p>As kids grow, parents start letting them go to school and extracurricular activities or hang out with friends by themselves. What parents do to settle their nerves when this happens? That's right, they buy their kid a phone so that he or she can always stay connected and notify adults if help is needed. At the same time, this measure cannot bring parents 100% peace of mind. The kid can just miss or ignore the call or message from his old folks leaving them anxious and furious about where they are and are they ok.</p>
<p>Luckily, the technology comes to the rescue. Almost all modern smartphones have GPS module that can be used to track their location. Add here the fact that teens today barely go somewhere without their phone – and you'll see the way to dealing with the worrying issue. Virtually, the only variable in this formula is the OS of the device your kid is using – Android or iOS. The chances are high that it is or will be iOS as Apple gadgets are extremely popular among teenagers today. With family tracker, iPhone can be easily turned into a tracking device that allows parents to keep tabs on their kids' whereabouts.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, the biggest advantage of family tracking via mobile phones is that it's arguably the best way for parents to feel more calm about their kids. The fact that you don't need to buy a separate gadget to monitor children's location is a significant benefit, too. By the way, this is a good reason to make sure your kid has a phone with him at all times instead of withdrawing it for any minor wrongdoing. Alternatively, you can utilize parental monitoring or screen time limiting apps to prevent children from spending too much time on the screen or using it at inappropriate moments (at school, table, bedtime, etc.).</p>
<p>And one more thing. Parental monitoring is an arguable issue. For some people, it is unacceptable; others see it as a must. The truth is somewhere in the middle – as it always is. Analyze dangers that your kid is exposed to while using a smartphone and what consequences monitoring can have to your relationships with your little ones. We advise you have a sincere talk with your son or daughter explaining that you don't mean to invade their privacy but wish solely to protect them.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-right-important">Use Pumpic as iPhone Family Tracker</h2>
            <div class="pt30 pb20">
			<p>Pumpic is a state-of-the-art mobile monitoring software designed specifically for parents. It works perfectly with all Apple handheld gadgets like iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch (we've got a <a class="a-default" href="/android-family-tracker.html">stable GPS tracking for Android</a>, too). Reliable location tracking is one of the most prominent Pumpic's features. The app helps parents monitor their kids' whereabouts at all times, thus decreasing the level of stress and providing adults with peace of mind.</p>
			<p>For iOS devices, Pumpic has two solutions – <strong>iCloud (without jailbreak)</strong> and <strong>iOS (with jailbreak)</strong> monitoring. Here's what both solutions can do:</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Provide real-time location monitoring;</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Let you request current location at any time;</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Show the entire location and routes history.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are several fundamental differences between iCloud and iOS solutions in terms of GPS tracking. The first one has already been mentioned – iCloud solution does not require jailbreaking the monitored iPhone. And the second distinction is that to track Apple device through iCloud, you don't need to install the app on it. Respectively, to reap the benefits of the iOS solution, you must install a visible app on the jailbroken device.</p>
				<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please, be advised that iOS (jailbreak) solution supports iOS versions only up to 9.1 as there is no jailbreak for iOS 10 available (as of the end of 2016). At the same time, the iCloud solution fully supports the latest iOS version.</p>
        <p>Monitoring data, collected by Pumpic, can be viewed through either web-based interface or the Control Panel app available for iOS and Android mobile devices. Pumpic aggregates not only location tracking info but also a broad range of other data (see the full list of monitoring features below). Hence, in order to avoid piling too much information and filling up phone's memory, the CP mobile app displays only the most important details (call and text logs, location, browsing history, etc.). The full reports are presented in the standard Control Panel accessible via any Internet browser. You can check out the demo Control Panel for each solution on our website:</p>
        <ul class="list-images">

				</ul>
        <p>Having installed Pumpic on your kid's iPhone, you'll always stay aware of where your son or daughter is and where he or she has been. Thus, parents are empowered to provide their children with a maximum possible protection from multiple dangers kids may face when out of home.</p>
