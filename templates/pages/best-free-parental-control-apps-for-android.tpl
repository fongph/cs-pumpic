            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>Smartphones and tablets connected to the Internet have become a trivial part of our world. Everyone’s got one. Meanwhile, many children find out how to use mobile devices before they can actually speak. And all these technologies go along kids’ lives, make them more curios, help to educate themselves, and very often expose them to danger.</p>
				<p>Cyberbullies insult kids on social media; haunt and offend them on instant chats. This horrible issue is known to be a major suicide factor among teens. Online predators try to gain children’s confidence and make them swallow the hook. Sexting is becoming a normal way of communication, while exchanging nude photos – the best way to show one’s feelings. Moreover, the Internet is full of explicit sexuality, violence, and hate. Our kids have unlimited access to all of this. At any time. With one single click. On their smartphone and tablets. And parents don’t know.</p>
				<p><a class="a-default" href="http://pumpic.com/android-parental-monitoring.html">Android parental monitoring applications</a> allow parents to bring the situation under control and protect their children. Pumpic is a good example of reliable protection in this case. Such software lets you follow kids’ activities on mobile devices as well as the Internet. Apply parental controls and see what your kids are texting, which websites they visit and people they talk to. Block undesired content inappropriate for kids. Block apps and other activities to prevent them from wasting time.</p>

                <img class="app-icon-left" src="{$img}/landings/free-android-parental-controls/Kids-Place.png" alt="">
			<p>Kids Place is parental controls that allow you to create childproof environment on Android smartphones and tablets. The app works as a separate user account, which lets parents specify particular apps and activities kids may use and lock the account with a password. It means that your children will not be able to access any other activities, but those authorized by parents.</p>
			<p>The app can prevent your kids from buying and downloading new applications, receiving incoming calls, and using wireless signals. Kids Place also has built-in options for online content filtering. With it, you can restrict the access to inappropriate photos and video files. Importantly, there is a timer feature in the app that allows parents to control children’s screen time.</p>
			<p>Kids Place parental control is a free app. However, there are some additional premium features, which become available only after an in-app purchase. With a pay version, you will be able to run Kids Place in a background mode, block uninstallation of the app, use an option to always start on reboot, and set a customized title for a home screen.</p>
			<p>Users admit Kids Place as a useful tool for parenting. Though some of them complain of periodical glitches that lock the phone completely, do not allow to exit the app, and cause failure to block some children’s activities. In some cases, it fails to prevent kids from closing Kids Place and passing over its restrictions.</p>
			<p>Kids Place lacks some significant parental control features as well:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>The app doesn’t log phone calls, but only blocks them as such. Thus, if you let your kids talk on the phone you will not be able to find out who called them and whom they called.</li>
			   <li>The same goes for text messages. The app doesn’t let parents view SMS and other texts for inappropriate words, cyberbullying, and sexting.</li>
			   <li>If you let your children use the Internet, you will not be able to monitor and prevent them from dangers. You can either block online access permanently or leave kids unattended.</li>

                <img class="app-icon-right" src="{$img}/landings/free-android-parental-controls/SecureTeen.png" alt="">
                <p>The app is a secure teen parental control that can help you protect your children online. It lets parents monitor online activities and even block some of them. In addition, SecureTeen logs sent and received text messages that can prevent children from bullying and sexting on the phone.</p>
				<p>SecureTeen features Internet filtering that includes category blocking, keyword blocking, and a black list option. It also allows blocking other applications installed on your kid’s device. Social media monitoring is limited to Facebook and Instagram only. The app prevents children from watching pornography and comprises a safe search option to clean search results from inappropriate content.</p>
				<p>Location tracking makes SecureTeen a useful helper for parents. With it, you will always know where you children are. In addition, remote control will let you monitor it all from your own computer as well as lock/unlock your kid’s device distantly. SecureTeen lets review browsing history. Thus, you will know which websites your children visit and control if your restrictions work.</p>
				<p>SecureTeen is free parental control software for Android smartphones and tablets. However, there is a pay version of the app, which has broader opportunities for $39.99 per 1 year for 3 devices.</p>
				<p>There are some good features SecureTeen lacks to be really reliable, when it comes to child safety:</p>
				<ul>
			       <li>The app doesn’t cover any instant messengers used widely by children (Snapchat, WhatsApp, Kik etc.), which expose them to dangerous cyberbullying, online predator attacks, and sexting.</li>
				   <li>There is no keylogger in addition to web history logging. Thus, as soon as your kids use the private browser mode, you will not be able to find out what is going on with them online.</li>
				   <li>Location tracking lacks geo-fencing alerts. It means that if your child gets into a restricted area, where he or she is not allowed to be, leaves school or home, when not supposed to, you will find out about it only when run your computer, not when it actually happens.</li>

                <img class="app-icon-left" src="{$img}/landings/free-android-parental-controls/Screen-Time.png" alt="">
			<p>The Screen Time app is designed for managing children’s time spent on smartphones and tablets. It allows parents to set various restrictions on kids’ devices as well as monitor browsing history and application downloads.</p>
			<p>With this parental control, you will be able to set daily time limits on each application separately, block specific apps at bedtime or while your kids are at school. Thus, you can restrict access to social media so as to prevent your children from using them during their classes.</p>
			<p>A time out feature lets parents block device activities with one single click on their own smartphones or tablets. The app also allows you to reward kids with bonus time on their mobile devices, if they show good task performance or improve their behavior. In addition, the Screen Time app lets review websites your kids visit, applications they download, as well as apps they use most of all.</p>
			<p>The app is meant to be free of charge. However, if you look closer, you will see that everything is not as it seems. When you install Screen Time for the first time, you can use all the features available, which comprises its Premium subscription plan. But after 14 days, you will have only two of them left. The rest will become available for $39.99 per year. Thus, with a free version the Screen Time parental control allows to review web and search history, and monitor one device remotely.</p>
			<p>There are some reasonable disadvantages the app should improve to provide kids with reliable protection:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>Screen Time doesn’t support social media monitoring. You can only block social apps completely. It means you will not be able to protect your kids against cyberbullies and online predators, at times when you allow them to use social networks.</li>
			   <li>There is no opportunity to track cell phone activities. Thus, you will not know who calls your kids. Text messages are also not supported. The app will not let you prevent your children from sexting or at least find out about such a misgivings activity.</li>
			   <li>Some users complain of high prices set by Screen Time Lab. Sure, there is a free version. However, it turns out to be useful after 14 days, which are a free trial of the Premium subscription.</li>

                <p>The software allows parents to monitor their kids on smartphones and tablets as well as block some mobile activities. It actually comes with two complementary applications: Abeona Parental Control installed on a parent’s device and Abeona Device Monitor installed on a child’s gadget.</p>
				<p>The Abeona app provides parents with an opportunity to view call logs, track location, and set geofences, which notify you with an alert once your children leave or enter specified areas. The app will also show you applications being used currently as well as general time spend on each app. If you see that your kids spend too much time on any of apps you consider inappropriate, you can block them easily thanks to Abeona’s functionality.</p>
				<p>When it comes to Internet use, the app allows parents to find out if their children are online or offline and follow websites they visit via Chrome.</p>
				<p>The app seems to be useful and reliable. However, when start using it, Abeona’s clients point on some reasonable glitches. Thus, in some cases the app doesn’t follow commands. When you try to block an app it may not work. Sometimes the app fails to open at all. Users also admit that children manage to pass over app blocking by repeatedly pressing on its icon.</p>
				<p>In addition, there are some more substantial disadvantages that should be considered:</p>
				<ul>
			       <li>Abeona doesn’t support old Android OS versions. The developers of the app admit it stating that old versions are not supposed to be supported at all due to technical reasons.</li>
				   <li>Location tracking and geo-fences don’t work without Internet connection. Thus, if your children have no Wi-Fi around, you will not be able to find out where they are.</li>
				   <li>The app provides web history monitoring only via the Chrome browser. Meanwhile, your children are free to use other browsers and you will not even know what they are surfing.</li>

			<p>The Parental Control Board app is designed for child protection, when it comes to cell phone use and online activities. It includes some useful features that will help you find out what your kids are doing on their smartphones and tablets, who calls and texts them, as well as where they are.</p>
			<p>Among the features of the app, you will find location tracking and geo-fencing to prevent your children from visiting restricted areas as and be notified as soon as they leave or enter set up zones on the map. Parental Control Board will also let you view calls logs and text messages. In addition, you can block callers by phone numbers and message senders by keywords.</p>
			<p>An application control feature allows parents to block specific apps and see how much time children spend playing, texting, surfing etc. Meanwhile, with help of a safe browsing mode you will be able to make sure your kids don’t look for inappropriate content on the web.</p>
			<p>An option called Kiosk Mode allows creating a separate user screen for kids with a specified number of apps they can use and phone numbers they can call. </p>
			<p>Users appreciate the app as good one, though some of them complain of many bugs. Thus, location tracking may work inaccurately, some issues with uninstallation appear from time to time, and Kiosk Mode sometimes fails to work. According to users, Parental Control Board crashes very often, though the issue gets solved after another version update.</p>
			<p>The app is meant to be free of charge, but in reality it is only a free trial. A year license for the Android version of Parental Control Board costs $12.</p>
			<p>The Parental Control Board app also has some other problems to be solved to improve reliability:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>Safe browsing is available only via a specific app called Fire Phoenix. It means that you will need to block all other browsers to prevent your kids from inappropriate search on the web. And keep blocking new ones they may download.</li>
			   <li>Social media monitoring is not supported. Meanwhile, it remains the main source of cyberbullying, online predator attacks, sexting, and other threats kids face on the Internet.</li>
			   <li>Location tracking has doubtful accuracy, which may cause confusion, when it will come to looking for your children on the map and in place.</li>

			<p>Qustodio introduces its parental control app as the most friendly and powerful solution for parental control. It is designed to protect children online and on the phone as well as to let you restrict activities and prevent kids from wasting their time.</p>
			<p>The app allows parents to block misgiving web sources including pornography and gambling. It will also let you set limits on time your children spend on the Internet and social networks. In addition, the Qustodio app provides application control enabling parents to view downloaded software and block those apps they consider inappropriate.</p>
			<p>With this parental control at your command, you will be able to track children’s location. Moreover, Qustodio lets review route history as far as 30 days back. The app also provides monitoring of call logs and SMS.</p>
			<p>There are clients, who complain of the app to consume too much of a battery. In addition, some children manage to find a way to disable Qustodio’s restrictions. The app sometimes fails to block set up content categories and kids can still access inappropriate sources.</p>
			<p>A free version of the app is limited and cannot provide enough features for reliable protection. Among others, the Qustodio app has some issues concerned with functionality that should be improved to make its security really helpful:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>The app lacks thorough social media monitoring, thought it allows blocking social apps and tracking time spent on them. Thus, you can either block these apps as such or let kids use them without any opportunity to monitor texting and protect from danger if needed.</li>
			   <li>Location tracking lacks geo-fencing. It means you will know where your kids are, only when you run your control panel. Geo-fencing here would get you notified about kids’ movements.</li>
			   <li>The app run the battery down, which is indicates its performance as doubtful one. Parental control apps of high quality are not supposed to use up the battery excessively.</li>

You can also set time schedules to prevent children from using devices at bed time or classes. The app allows you to specify at what time each application can be used.</p>
				<p>Kakatu takes care of your kids online as well .Thus, you can block inappropriate content like pornography, violence, and horror. When it comes to cell phone use, the app lets you block incoming calls against undesirable contacts. Kakatu includes the Parent Mode and Kids Mode, which will secure your kids against accessing inappropriate content and activities on your own cell phone or tablet.</p>
				<p>Some users of Kakatu point that children can easily bypass its restrictions or even delete the app without parents knowing. At the same time, the Kakatu parental control has other issues that leave a lot to be desired:</p>
				<ul>
			       <li>The app doesn’t provide comprehensive browsing history control. You are not allowed to track the incognito mode and can only monitor online activities on the surface.</li>
				   <li>Concerning social media tracking, parents can only view statistics on app usage, meanwhile communication with strangers, which is the main source of dangers if left unattended.</li>
				   <li>Kakatu allows monitoring and blocking phone calls and avoids text messaging. However, modern children prefer texting to making calls. Thus, a major part of children’s cell phone activities remains without control.</li>

			<p>Parental monitoring by iWawa provides a way of making Android devices safer for children. With this app, parents should have no worries, when handing a smartphone or tablet to their little kids. Application use and web browsing remain under your control, meanwhile your children – under iWawa’s protection.</p>
			<p>The functionality of the iWawa app let you choose from among applications that your children are allowed to use. If you let your kids access the Internet, you can also choose websites with appropriate content and block those containing data restricted for the underage.</p>
			<p>In addition, iWawa feature a timer. You can create multiple user accounts for your kids and specify how much time each of the, can spend with smartphones in hands. You can also choose music and videos available for your kids’ access.</p>
			<p>On one hand, iWawa looks good enough to be helpful for parents. On the other one, there are some disadvantages that should be considered:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>The app has too poor functionality to help you control your children’s personal devices. Thus, it may be used only on your own device at times, when you give it to your kids.</li>
			   <li>If you let your kids enter social networks, there is no opportunity to follow their activities inside social apps.</li>
			   <li>iWawa provides only block/allow options. Thus, parents cannot monitor their children’s activities, but only restrict them.</li>

And it didn’t. As expected, Pumpic was a pay app. Still, I decided to try it and ordered a month plan. After a month of using it to monitor my son, I decided to prolong my plan for a year. Pumpic provides amazing monitoring. I can check literally everything on my kid’s phone. I’ll keep using it, until my son grows up.”</p>
