		<p>Today, Internet filtering and content blocking is a hot topic worldwide. The discussion about its competence is being held on multiple levels – from World Wide Web monitoring to restricting employees access to job search sites. But while freedom of speech activists continue to argue with the national governments around the globe over censorship on the Internet, there is no question about limiting kids’ access to inappropriate online content. Porn, drugs, hateful sites, gambling, dangerous online communities – these are just a few examples of perils that lie in wait for children in the Net.</p> 
	    <p>Nowadays 91% of teens 13 to 17 years old surf the Internet using various mobile devices - smartphones, tablets and other gadgets without proper content control software. As a result, monitoring their actions and ensuring their online safety is extremely difficult.</p>

        <p>Hence, when it comes to kids’ online activity, using built-in or standalone content filter software is not an option – it is an imperative. Thankfully, if you do want to keep your kids' eyes away from inappropriate content, there is plenty specialized filtering tools available for all types of devices and OS.</p>
		<p>So it is your duty as a parent to choose the best software and its settings to make your children’s Internet surfing a pleasant and safe experience. Just keep in mind that you will have to cover not only your family or kid’s personal computer but also his or her handheld device – a smartphone or tablet.</p>

        {*<p>Using monitoring software to protect kids is an urgent issue of contemporary society.
        On one hand, technological progress opened new doors for the evolution of humanity; on the other one, it has
        resulted in a lot of dangers in return. And children are exposed to these dangers much more than others.</p>
        <ul>
		    <li>72% of children worldwide use smartphones, 33% of them are under 8 years old</li>
            <li>23% of teenagers report that they feel addicted to games on mobile devices</li>
            <li>69% of boys and girls under 18 have experienced cyberbullying via mobile phones</li>
		</ul>
        <p>As a parent you should always keep the situation under control, be aware of possible threats coming from the Internet,
        how to resist it, and if a reliable Android parental monitoring app can be the way out:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>control cell phone usage</li>
            <li>follow online activity</li>
            <li>track routes and location</li>

    title="Tips To Choose the Right Internet Filtering Software"
    blockBg='light'}
    <p>Internet content filtering is using a program or a mobile application to screen and/or restrain access to websites and pages that are deemed objectionable. It can be used as a separate program or can be integrated with firewall, router or even server. Filtering software mainly uses ‘black’ and ‘white’ lists of websites, while minority utilizes algorithmic techniques to determine whether website falls into a blocked group.</p>
	<p>Although it’s a remedy to know there are many tools out there that can do the job, you still will have to do some ‘homework’ when selecting proper filtering software and ensuring secure Internet surfing for your kids and teens. Here are several useful tips for parents about this task:</p>
    <ul class="list-images">
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/content-filtering-software_icon1.png" title="Maturity levels" alt="Use predefined age-based filter presets" class="lc-3" /><strong>Maturity levels.</strong> When choosing the filtering software, check whether it has an option to block Internet content for children based on their age. The thing is, content that is inappropriate for 8-9-year-old kids is totally OK (and sometimes even useful) for 15-16-year-old teens. ‘Maturity levels’ is a simple and handy feature that adds flexibility to content filtering.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/content-filtering-software_icon2.png" title="Black and White website lists" alt="Create black and white website lists" class="lc-2" /><strong>‘Black’ and ‘White’ website lists.</strong> You should check how your preferred filtering software makes use of governmental and/or specialized non-profit organization, which create and update ‘white’ and ‘black’ lists of Internet pages. If the program’s algorithms include checking with those lists approved by experts – it’s a huge advantage.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/content-filtering-software_icon3.png" title="Mobile content filtering" alt="Set parental control filtering on mobile devices" class="lc-3" /><strong>Mobile content filtering.</strong> Make sure your kid is protected from undesirable content not only on PC but also on a handheld device. Most popular filtering programs have mobile apps available. Also, you can find separate Internet content filter for Android or iOS. However, many parents opt to install on their kid’s smartphone or tablet a comprehensive parental monitoring app.</li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/content-filtering-software_icon4.png" title="Search Engines Content Filters" alt="Use SafeSearch option on search engines" class="lc-2" /><strong>Search Engines Content Filters.</strong> Check whether a software you’re planning to use can integrate or cooperate with the most popular search engines to provide search results free from explicit content. Actually, you can set up a ‘clean’ search on Google or Yahoo by yourself. Both engines have SafeSearch option that weeds out inappropriate content and information from search results.</li>
    </ul>
	<p></p>
    <p>Even if you choose the most comprehensive and expensive solution out there, remember that it is not 100% foolproof. When it comes to raising children, humanity still didn’t invent anything better than a parent’s example and guiding word. So do whatever it takes to establish a trustworthy relationship with your kid and explain why some materials on the Web are objectionable and mustn’t be watched. Moreover, try to spend time regularly with your children when they’re surfing the Internet and guide them through all online pitfalls.</p>

                                    <p>“Great app! A bit tricky installation process, but the result is worth all efforts. Spent 20 minutes to set it up and then forgot where settings are. Now I can track websites that my daughter visits and block inappropriate ones if necessary. Call and text logs give me the idea what she is up to. And yeah, location tracking is just priceless:).”</p>

                                    <p>“We started using Pumpic a year ago when we changed our son’s cell phone to Android smartphone – and we don’t regret it even for a second. Being a not very tech-savvy person, I haven’t experienced any troubles navigating through the app as the interface is tidy and straightforward. Had several minor technical issues after Android updates, but support resolved them quickly. Recommend!”</p>

My primary target was to monitor son’s text messages as it is his main way of communication with everybody – and thanks to Pumpic, I’ve got it covered now. Simple design, easy navigation, many functions – what else you might expect from reliable parental control app? Pumpic is worth every penny I’ve spent on it.”</p>
