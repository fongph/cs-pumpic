; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.
; Possible Values:
;   static  env[a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;
;   dynamic env[the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the
;             following directives. With this process management, there will be
;             always at least 1 children.
;             pm.max_children      env[the maximum number of children that can
;                                    be alive at the same time.
;             pm.start_servers     env[the number of children created on startup.
;             pm.min_spare_servers env[the minimum number of children in 'idle'
;                                    state (waiting to process). If the number

;                                    number then some children will be created.

;  ondemand env[no children are created at startup. Children will be forked when

; The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to 'static' and the

; This value sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be
; served. Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.
; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP
; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't
; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.
; Note: Used when pm is set to 'static', 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'
; Note: This value is mandatory.
