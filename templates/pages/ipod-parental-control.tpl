	    <p class="text-center f-light">If you ask your kids which mp3 player they would like to have, most of them will surely choose the iPod Touch. What makes it so popular, you may wonder? The iPod Touch is almost the same as the iPhone, though calls and SMS are not supported. Everyone wants to have the iPhone, doesn’t it?</p>
		<p class="text-center f-light">Like any other Apple device, the iPod lets users access the Internet and utilize its benefits to the fullest. Thus, children can chat on instant messengers, shoot, share, and like photos on social media, and play games online. The Internet is dangerous for kids for so many reasons. That’s why careful parents should know <a class="a-default" href="http://pumpic.com/security/can-i-monitor-my-kids-ipod-touch/" target="_blanc">how to apply iPod parental controls</a>.</p>

Being engaged in online activities day and night, kids not often realize real consequences of irresponsible behavior on the web. Cyberbullying, online predators, sexting, inappropriate content, and much more threats are what happens when children forget of Internet security measures. As a parent, you should take the situation under your personal control and keep your eyes open widely.</p>

He likes it so much that goes to bed and wakes up with it in hands. It makes me worry a little. I know there’s such a fever in kids, when they keep playing and browsing and can’t stop. I’m afraid it might turn into addiction or he might face a kind of danger online. I decided to use parental control and set iPod time limit on his activities. Finally I can control the time he spends on his favorite device.”</p>

A friend of mine recommended Pumpic. The app lets me block the YouTube application permanently or set time limits on its running. There are so many useful options in Pumpic that I can keep complete control of my kid’s iPod from anywhere I go.
