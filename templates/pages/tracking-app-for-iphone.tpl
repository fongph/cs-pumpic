	<p>Our modern life is full of rush and changes. To succeed at work, create a harmonic family and be good at parenting may become a real challenge. Anyway, the happiness of the children, their safety and wellbeing always are a number one priority for every mom and dad. Many parents spend a lot of time and energy to be aware of all of the child’s news, interests, friends and progress in studies, try to be by their side at any moment and always guide them wherever they go. However, parents can succeed in all this with minimum efforts. In most cases, all they need for that is a parental monitoring app.</p>
	<p>A parental monitoring app is a software that enables parents to track the children’s location through GPS, view their online activity, calls, texts, photos, browsing history, block applications and websites children can access in order to prevent them from viewing inappropriate content and protect them against cyberbullies, online fraudsters and predators.</p>

        <p>As you can see from the statistics above, modern teenagers worship Apple iPhones. According to Pew Research Center, they spend on average up to 3,3 hours online and up to mind-boggling 9 hours on the screen every day. This generally means that they have smartphones with them at any moment. Of course, spending so much time on the screen and the Internet is not healthy for children. Parents should set certain rules and restrictions on gadget use by kids. However, parents may also turn their children’s smartphone addiction to advantage with the help of a <a class="a-default" href="/iphone-tracking-software.html">iPhone parental tracking software</a>. Moreover, with a tracking app for iPhone, parents can always know the location of their child even without buying a special GPS tracking device.</p>

            <div class="pt30 pb20">
			<p>One of the most popular features out of those that a parental monitoring app may offer, is tracking child’s relocations. Parents physically can’t be with their children for 24 hours every day. Being not able to know where their child is and what he/she is doing feels terrible. With the help of a tracking feature, parents will always know the exact location of their child. This confidence will save them from stress and constant worries. The market offers various devices designed specifically for tracking an iPhone user. However, many would agree that an app, which has more useful functions would be a good alternative.</p>
			<p>Of course, Pumpic’s functionality is not limited to showing you where the kid is at any given moment. Talking about all the various features that a parental monitoring app may provide, we feel certain to say that Pumpic can meet any parents’ needs. <strong>Here are some of the most popular and useful monitoring functions:</strong></p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Parents can monitor their child’s online activity. Browsing history and bookmarks become visible to a concerned parent. Moreover, parents can block adult and other inappropriate or just distracting websites.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />When it comes to online activity monitoring, one can’t ignore instant Internet messaging – and Pumpic allows parents to keep track of Viber, Snapchat, Skype, Kik and many other messengers.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Also, parents are enabled to follow their kids’ activity on all the most popular social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />Calls monitoring provides parents with the log of incoming and outgoing calls. You get the precise contact data: number, name, time of the call and its duration.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />SMS tracking gives you the full picture of who the kids are messaging with. You can even read deleted SMS, so no secret conversation would escape your attention.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />It is also possible to look through contacts, calendar, and notes. Thus, you can keep staying aware of scheduled events and plans.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Combined, these features enable parents to protect their kid from cyberbullying, online predators, identity theft, sexting, etc. These problems are too widespread nowadays and may cause serious physical and psychological problems to a child.</p>

        <p>It is worth knowing that unlike many stalking apps offered on the Internet, parental control apps used by parents to monitor their kids’ location and online activity, are absolutely legal. The only precaution is that you must own the monitored device or obtain the owner's permission to perform monitoring.</p> 
	    <p>Having once installed such an app on your child’s smartphone, you don’t have to worry about anything else as the app will keep working all the time. A monitoring app is easy to use; its menu of features is intuitive and simple to handle even for less tech-savvy parents. It is obvious that such an app is far more useful than a stand-alone iPhone tracking device could be. Being multifunctional and working remotely, it lets parents provide a maximum possible protection from any kind of troubles and dangers that children may face online or while being away from their home.</p>
		<p>At the same time, it is important to say that the parental monitoring apps, no matter how useful they are, can’t replace the real parental guidance and may just assist in parenting in terms of a busy pace of the modern life. The attention and care of moms and dads expressed towards their children are priceless. So, do your best and spend as much time with your beloved little ones as possible.</p>
