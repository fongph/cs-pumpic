	<p>In the not-so-distant past, Internet parental monitoring was all about preventing children from visiting inappropriate sites on the family computer and tweaking a simple filter to blocking certain explicit pages. Today, though, thing have become much more complicated than that. Now almost every kid owns or has access to the mobile Internet-connected device, be it a smartphone, tablet or another gadget. Teens are literally glued to their mobile screens with roughly one-third of them appreciating a smartphone to the same extent they value parents.</p>
	<p>At the same time, the list of digital dangers had also become much longer, absorbing such elements as cyberbullying, sexting, online predators, etc. Protecting kids remotely from new threats is nowadays one of the main concerns of worried parents.</p>

        <p>When considering to monitor children or not, parents would inevitably face an ethical issue of finding a balance between protecting their kids and not violating their privacy. This is the question that parents must answer themselves. Keep in mind, however that no technology has been yet invented that can read a teenager’s mind. On the other hand, as the old saying goes, little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>
		<p>If you do decide to monitor your kids via digital means, we urge you to have a frank and detailed talk with them to explain why and how you’re going to keep an eye on them. 93% of parents claim having talked to their teens about online safety, while only 61% of children report really having this conversation.</p>

	    <p class="text-center f-light">There many ways to make web browsing safer for your kids, some of them being really simple, some of them being very sophisticated. As the first step, you can tweak the browser you’re using or apply Internet filtering tool. A bit more advanced step is to install a special software for the router. These measures are most effective to implement on family computers. But when it comes to dealing with mobile devices, you either have to limit yourself to using built-in restrictions, or install a specialized app. Thankfully, today there is a wide range of state-of-the-art parental control software that you can choose from.</p>

                        <p>Any Android and iOS mobile device has onboard parental controls. They allow setting certain limits and filters without any additional software. Often these features are based on the child’s age and may have a several presets for different age groups. It’s generally recognized that Apple ‘Restrictions’ are much handier and well thought through than standard Android built-in parental controls. However, they both are not flexible enough and allow for bypassing parental restrictions. But anyway, it’s still way better than nothing.</p>

        <p class="text-center f-light">It’s your duty as a parent to protect your children from all kinds of risks that the Internet bears. But it’s up to you as a parent to choose how you will do that – with the help of built-in device capabilities, using a particular software or totally banning kids from using Internet-connected devices (which seems to be a mission impossible these days). But if you do decide to limit kids’ online opportunities or download Internet monitoring software, have an honest talk with your daughter or son! Thus, you will not undermine their trust.</p>
