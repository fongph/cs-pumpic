	<p>Not only does a smartphone facilitate a life of an adult today, but also it has become an inseparable and the most entertaining thing for our young ones. Kids are literary hung-up on mobile devices for numerous functions. Gadgets help to console and educate themselves, get in touch with anybody anywhere and anytime, explore the online world using the Internet and various apps.</p>
	<p>Despite that, for kids, texting remains the most used (and often overused) feature on smartphones. Today, mobile messaging opportunities are provided via various facilities: SMS, online messengers, instant messaging apps, etc.</p>

        <p>When it comes to texting on Apple devices, there is one thing that is definitely worth looking at – iMessage. iMessage is a proprietary messenger for iOS gadgets that uses Internet traffic for text transmission. Unlike regular SMS that requires a text plan or a one-time fee to send a message, iMessage works through the enabled internet connection. Also, when chatting via iMessage, it is possible to see if a text has been delivered, opened and read.</p>
		<p>Texting is an incredibly convenient and popular way of children communication. Provided they use Apple devices, kids have access to the default iMessage app, which enables them to enjoy advanced texting without extra pay, just through Wi-Fi or mobile data plan. However, chatting is often abused and becomes time-consuming. Thus, tracking iMessage texts and other messaging activity is imperative altogether. If used excessively, texting may lead to aggravation of kids’ productivity, health issues or even problems in relations with friends.</p>

	    <p class="text-center f-light">iMessage is a powerful instant Apple messaging tool. However, when used by kids, intentions to chat with others may be unfortunately complemented with purposes of bullying, harassing, deceiving and sexting. Therefore, in order to protect children from bad impacts and prevent unpleasant consequences, the principles of iMessage use should be revised.</p>
		<p class="text-center f-light">No matter which <a class="a-default" href="/iphone-tracking-software.html">Apple device needs to be tracked</a> – iPhone, iPad, or iPod, they all come with the iMessage app by default. Today, with the increasing importance of supervising kids’ online activity, there are two main ways to follow iMessages.</p>

                        <p>This method can be implemented, provided a parent has an Apple mobile as well. Both children’s and parent’s devices must be connected to the same iCloud account and have Internet connection enabled. To turn on message monitoring, go to iMessage settings on your device and link your own and your child’s gadgets to the field “You can be reached by iMessage at”. Ultimately, this procedure makes iMessage an iPhone app for monitoring text messages, and you’ll be able to see kid’s iMessage conversations right on your iPhone or iPad.</p>

For example, Pumpic can monitor iMessage via iCloud without the need to jailbreak the device. Moreover, such software doesn’t stop on monitoring messages as it is a comprehensive solution to surveil all kinds of activities on a smartphone or tablet. Hence, you can supervise Internet activity, apps/device usage, social networks, emails, media files exchanged, etc. Also, you’re enabled to track GPS locations, routes history and set geofences.</p>

        <p class="text-center f-light">The lack of monitoring kids’ activity on a mobile device may be fraught with risks and unpredictable results. Our young ones have learnt a lot and became quite tech-savvy together with the rapid development of technologies. So, in order not to be outsmarted by kids, parents should always keep an eye on what children are up to when using a smartphone.</p>
		<p class="text-center f-light">In the case of iOS monitoring, it is possible to monitor iMessage texts using an onboard feature. However, kids’ device activity is not limited only to a regular texting. Therefore, using comprehensive parental monitoring apps to get a hands-on advantage of tracking various activities and keep kids away from online threats might be a really good idea.</p>
