	<p>The security of your device is an issue that should be taken very seriously. Due to the Pew Research Center, 90% of Americans own a smartphone and 42% use tablet regularly.  No doubt, the devices should be protected from getting into the wrong hands. Most people wonder how to lock Android phone as they use Facebook, Twitter and Skype on their device. Surely, they don’t want anyone messing with their accounts, so try to protect their sensitive data.</p>
	<p>Now it is very easy to protect apps with Password or Pattern on all devices. The most popular apps are AppLock, Smart App Protector, Smart Lock, and Perfect App Protector. It’s really great that Android OS allows to set a passcode lock on the screen, but most users find it inconvenient. Entering the PIN takes time and makes angry when the first try is not successful.</p>
	<p>If you wonder whether can you lock apps on Android easily, check the smart alternative – parental control apps. They are easy to install and use and provide parents a wide spectre of functions to protect children.</p>

He started to spend a lot of time on the Internet and I was worried that he could be negatively influenced by his peers or some strangers. I couldn't find the right approach to him, so started to search for some lock apps to limit the access to improper websites and links. Unfortunately, all of them were not legal to use. Thankfully, I was lucky to know about parental control apps that are legitimate to install. Right now Pumpic helps me to follow my son's online activities to ensure he's in safe.”</p>
