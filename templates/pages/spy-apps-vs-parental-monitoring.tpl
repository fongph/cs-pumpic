                <p>In the whole amount of Android mobile monitoring software one may come across online, there are mainly two types of products – Spy Apps and Parental Monitoring Apps. What is the difference (if any), and what to choose? Here’s a little guide on Android phone spyware.</p>
                <p>Finding a spy app on Android is rather easy, but downloading and installing one may cause some significant troubles later on. Such programs are illegal to use. Spy software is designed for discreetly keeping track of someone by installing this application on his or her phone. And a spy app for Android is undetectable. Needless to say that these apps are going against the rules and laws of civilized world, where everyone has the right for privacy.</p>
                <p>Cell phone parental controls software is a legal thing that allows parents to ensure their kids’ online security. This have become a real need due to the recent bullying and overall cybercrimes kids fall victims of. <a class="a-default" href="/android-parental-monitoring.html" >Such apps</a> can only be used by parents to monitor their children, and there is no chance of other ways one can use them.</p>
                <p>Android parental controls applications differ in options and settings, so reading some reviews beforehand will help making the right choice. Be wise and use this type of software to protect your loved ones in the best and legal way.</p>

	<img class="app-icon-left" src="{$img}/landings/why-not-using-spy-apps.png" alt="">
	<p>Today parental control for smartphones and mobile devices is a must. This fact is hard to refute. According to statistics, the amount of time kids spend looking at their mobile devices grows rapidly. And about 24% of teens confess they are online almost constantly. Yet the question about what type of an app parents should use is an essential one to answer. There are plenty of apps facilitating your watching over a teen’s activities, but not everyone is a good choice.</p>
	<p>Google Play pages are full of various applications on different topics. If you look at monitoring applications, two large groups are obvious. These are actual Android phone monitoring apps and spyware. With some of shared options and functions these apps may seem to be the same. But it is a lack of information that may get you to making a wrong decision. Here is a brief explanation for newbies in the industry. As well as reasons why using Android phone spyware is worse than a parental control app.</p>
	<p>As long as Android is open OS, new apps for it appear every day. Android mobile spy software is popular, and numerous apps claim to provide the best results. Some of such applications are free for use, others ask for a price to be paid for information you get. But no matter which spyware you choose, it is all positioned as exactly spying on someone. And headers like ‘Catch Your Cheating Spouse with Spy App’ only prove the point.</p>
	<p>Another point against spy software is its illegal status. It is not a secret that spying on people cannot be legal in any country. Even as general rules for personal issues are being different for every country. This is a part of reason spy applications work in disguise. Attentive readers also notice a disclaimer saying they have no responsibility towards a user. And if you use a spy application and get caught, you are on your own.</p>
	<p>Android parental controls applications are absolutely legal, and even advised for usage. They were designed specifically for watching over underage children. Thus, apps can only be used by parents, and there is no chance for using these apps to meet other needs.</p>
