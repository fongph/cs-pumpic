	<p>Worrying about kids is the defining and inherent trait of being a parent. Educating children on the security issues, explaining how to stay safe in various situations, and taking measures to avert all possible dangers is the distinctive trait of being a really good parent. This is true not only for the real life but also for the digital one as it has become the inherent part of modern-day kids’ and teens’ lives.</p>
	<p>The thing is that the Internet – despite all its values – can be a dangerous place for children of all ages. Cyberbullying, sexting, online predators, identity theft, objectionable content – this is not anywhere near the full list of perils that lie in wait for careless underage users online. That’s why the question is not whether to utilize child internet safety software, but what monitoring and protection software to utilize.</p>

                        teenagers access the Internet at least couple times a week, and almost 70% do it daily. The majority of them surfs the Web via their own Internet-enabled mobile devices (like smartphones and tablets) and personal computers. The lesser part uses family computers to go online.

        <p>Although it’s beyond parents’ power to make the Internet a kid-safe place, they can at least do two things: 1) make the access to the Web’s dark corners much more complicated; and 2) keep monitoring their kids’ online activity to stay aware if the defensive system cracks. Installing family Internet safety software on kids’ smartphones and tablets as well as on family computers is rather easy solution. But remember that this is just a supplementary tool that would work best if you talk to your child and thoroughly explain to him or her what pitfalls are hiding behind the gadget screen.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Parental Monitoring Apps</h2>
            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <img class="img-align-right" alt="Children Internet safety software" title = "Set up Internet security tool easily" src="{$img}/landings/child-internet-safety-software_icon.png" width="207px" height="208px" />
                <p>As we’ve already mentioned, modern teens hardly can live even a couple hours without looking up into their handheld devices. And while ensuring family safe browsing on your home PC is not a big problem, keeping track of what websites your kid visits on their smartphone or tablet is a lot harder. Moreover, as teens intensively use phones for texting and calls, a standard web filter would be not of much help here.</p>
				<p>There aren’t too many options how parents can set up the Internet protection on their children’s mobile devices. Firstly, they can use built-in iOS or Android safety tools (like “Restrictions” on iPhone). But onboard utilities often have fairly limited functionality. That’s why many parents prefer utilizing specially developed monitoring apps.</p>
				<p>Here are five major advantages parental control apps like Pumpic have:</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is <strong>convenient</strong> – you can keep track of your kid's activities and relocations remotely from any browser and any device at any given time.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It has a <strong>wide range of functions</strong> – besides web filtering, Pumpic monitors calls, SMS and IM messages, follows social media accounts, blocks apps, tracks GPS location and much more.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is <strong>simple to use</strong> – the app is easily installed and set up. The straightforward interface won’t confuse you. With the help of the Control Panel, you can monitor your child’s every move and interaction in one place.</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It <strong>enhances security</strong> – thanks to its multiple functions, the app prevents unacceptable online behavior and averts many digital dangers (sexting, cyberbullying, identity theft, online predators, etc.)</li>
				   <li><img src="{$img}/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" />It is <strong>legal</strong> – parental control apps are absolutely legal to use to monitor underage children, unlike spyware programs that are used mainly by employers and jealous partners or spouses.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Considering the huge variety of functions that a comprehensive parental monitoring app provides, you can rest assured that you’ve taken whatever measures are necessary to child-proof the Internet. The only thing you can do to fix the result is to maintain trustworthy relations with your kids and teens. You should explain to them why you monitor their activities and keep talking to them regularly about proper behavior and ways not to get into troubles.</p>

                                    <p>Pumpic is great. It literally saved relations with my 16-year-old daughter! For almost half of the year, she has been keeping secret that she join a religion-based community. She just was afraid to tell me because I’m atheistic.
