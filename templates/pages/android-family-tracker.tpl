<p>Of course, using a family tracker to trace your partner or kids with GPS or via their mobile device is definitely an arguable topic. And if checking in on another grown-up (for example, wife or husband) is indisputably yours choice to make, the case of tracking kids is quite different. On the one hand, it is your right and even duty as a parent to make sure your kids are OK wherever they are, if they have arrived at their destinations and if they are where they say they’ll be. On the other hand, there is the argument that using GPS to track your kids shows that you don’t trust them.</p>
<p>Today, there are dozens of ways to trace the location of your relatives – from tiny keychain devices to multifunctional mobile apps that can be installed on a smartphone. There is even a clock-styled display that can show all family members whereabouts! Anyway, it is absolutely up to you to choose a way to stay aware of where your close ones are and find a balance between tracking and privacy.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-right-important">Case: How Family Tracking Helped to Locate Missing Child</h2>
            <div class="pt30 pb20">
			<p>The ability to use a cell phone or a tablet as a GPS tracking device is arguably one of the greatest innovations in Mobile technology. Whether you need to track Android device, iPhone or iPad – there are plenty respective tools to accomplish this mission. And, by the way, there already have been examples when family tracking apps helped to find missing children.</p>
			<p>One of such cases took place in Georgia, US, when parental monitoring app installed on a minor's smartphone turned out to be a crucial tool that provided police with the information needed to locate a missing boy. It all started when the SIM card was removed from his phone, and the kid disappeared for several days. The boy’s mother presumed he met with another person that was prohibited from seeing the child. She managed to confirm this fact by reviewing the GPS log of her son’s cell phone relocation in the days before he had disappeared. Just a few hour after she told the police about it, the boy was found by a patrol officer and brought to his anxious mother.</p>
			<p><strong>This missing minor case fully demonstrates the major advantages of family tracking via mobile devices:</strong></p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />You don't need to buy a new gadget to monitor kids’ whereabouts – the cell or smart phone are perfectly good for this as children always carry them around 24/7.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />You can track others in real time directly from your smartphone or through a computer with an Internet connection.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />You can see the full log of entire route history – what places your kid, wife or husband visited and how they got there.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />With some tracking apps, you can set geofences and get alerts when a person leaves the area that he or she is supposed to stay in.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Eventually, knowing where you kids are will increase their safety and provide you with a peace of mind. Yet, the technology still has some drawbacks that you should know about. E.g., some tracking apps have workarounds that people who don’t want to be tracked can use. They can turn the phone off, switch on the airplane mode or simply leave the phone at home and not bring it with them. That’s why it is critical to talk frankly to the person you wish to track and explain that this is just a protective measure for their own good.</p>
				<p>It is of particular importance to have such conversation with teens, because if you try to track your kids without them knowing, they might perceive it as an intrusion of their privacy. Take, for example, Pumpic: it is a visible app designed for ethical and legal use only. It runs openly and is not hidden from the owner of the device. Moreover, we urge you to obtain the owner’s permission to track her or his device before installing the app. You should explain your kids, parents or companions the difference between spying and monitoring and tell about the dangers that you want to avert by tracking their location.</p>
