	<p>A cell phone has become an irreplaceable gadget not only for you but for your children as well. They play, read, study, and entertain while holding their favourite device in hands. Therefore, you should have a frequent conversation with them about the time they spend on phones and tablets, discuss the content they share online, keep track of the websites they visit and monitor their social networks activity. And a lot of parents do so. But talk is often not enough, as it will not stop some strangers from contacting your child on a phone and via social media. It will not prevent identity thefts and cyber bullying, and it will not tell you whereabouts of your child. That is where a trustworthy cell phone parental control app becomes invaluable. Most of the above mentioned dangers can simply be averted with the help of such an app.</p>

        <p>While you can discuss many things with your children, in order to build a mutual trust, there are always some topics teenagers are too embarrassed to talk about. And growing up they also learn to delete their phone call records, internet search history and use vault apps to hide sensitive communications and photos. Besides, their emotions can cloud their judgement, leaving them an easy target for online predators and cyber bullies.</p>
		<p>Cell phone monitoring for parents becomes a key moment in modern parenting. With a quality parental control app, you may see all incoming messages and block them before they can hurt your child. You may browse search queries even if they were deleted. You may set geo-fences to get alerts when your child leaves a specific area. And you can review and approve everything your kid posts on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc, to prevent possible damages to their reputation in the future.</p>

            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>Everything you ever post online stays on the Internet and can be easily found, even if you think you deleted it. Your kid's proudest moments and the happiest days, marked by posts of joy on Facebook, will stay there forever, as well as posts of anger, frustrations, and embarrassment. And they may not matter to you now, but when he or she starts looking for colleges, applying for a job, anything ever posted without a good judgement may hurt the reputation and diminish chances to get the desired place in life.</p>
                <p>With a parental control app you can take the following steps to secure your child's future:</p>					
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Preview all media before it gets posted online or shared with anyone even from address book contacts.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Remotely control the device, and even block it, in case you see that your child gets sidetracked or distracted while doing homework.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Control browser and search history to make sure you know about sensitive issues in your child's life. This simple step will allow you to notice some early signals of troubling behaviour and prevent a possible crisis.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Set geo-fences and get notified when your teen kid decides to sneak out of the bedroom to go to a somewhat suspicious party late at night.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" class="lc-1" style="left: -29px;"/>Monitor and control all the messages on the device, be it WhatsApp or Viber, Facebook IM or Kik, Skype, SMS or MMS. This option ensures that your child will not fall victim of cyber bullying, online predators, or identity thefts.</li><p></p>
				<p>With the help of the app, those preventive measures can be taken even while you are away on a business trip or at an important meeting. And emerging problems can be tackled right away. </p>
