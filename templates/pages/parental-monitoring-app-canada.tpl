        <p class="text-center f-light">Online danger comprising cyberbullying, sexting, and child abuse is burning issues in Canada these days. In fact, Canadian kids of 13 years old have the ninth highest rate of bullying both offline and on the web compared to other countries. That’s why understanding possible danger, explaining it to kids, and applying parental control appropriately secures your loved ones and even saves their lives.</p>

                    <li>In 2012, 15-year-old Amanda Todd posted a video online. There she told her story of being cyberbullied relentlessly. Soon after, she took her own life.</li> 
                    <li>42-year-old Robert Campbell was charged for cyberbullying and online harassment of 38 teenage victims from different states. 18 of them were from Ottawa.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Internet is dangerous environment for children and it must be held under control constantly. Children take online reality too seriously and that’s why parents should monitor what kind of content they see, what kind of posts they like and share, and most importantly whom they communicate with. Nowadays in Canada thanks to parental monitoring software, parents can track each step children take on the web and thus, prevent stranger danger in the making.</p>

                <p>With online reality penetrating deeply into children’s lives, cyberbullying cases including distributing explicit and sexually suggestive photos and videos increase rapidly. Just as rapidly, it becomes a burning issue of the society, since sometimes online bullying forces teenagers to commit suicide.</p>
                <p>In May 2015, a new law came into force in Canada. It prohibits non-consensual distribution of intimate content and applies to everyone, not just the underage. At the same time, Canadian Criminal Code prescribes punishment for both offline and online bullying. A restraint for that depends on the exact nature of the bullying behavior.</p>

                                        <p>“When we moved to Ontario and my son encountered bullying at school and was systematically bullied online, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know if there were any reliable cell phone tracker in Canada. I searched online and came across Pumpic. I was so surprised and pleased, when I saw from how many dangers the app can prevent my son. I now can monitor if someone offends him and take action instantly.”</p>

I also monitor her text communication and web sites she visits. I don’t want her to get into troubles or fall under influence of a bad company. That’s why I prefer mobile security. Pumpic helps me handle everything I need to protect my girl from strangers.”</p>

Parenting is a tough task and responsibility as you must always be there, take care, and keep your eyes open. Thankfully, Pumpic provides such an opportunity.
