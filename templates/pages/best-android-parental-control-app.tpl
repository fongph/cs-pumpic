			<p>The first parental control for Android to begin <a class='a-default' href='/reviews'>our reviews</a> with is Kidslox. The app allows limiting screen time and blocking other applications on your children’s devices. With Kidslox, parents can block games and other entertainment apps, social media, and web browsers.</p>
			<p>This parental control software will also let you specify schedules for using the target device as well as switch it from normal performance to restricted one. Kidslox is protected with a secret key. It means that your child will not be able to brake your limits or apply any other changes without your permission.</p>
			<p>Kidslox will cost you $6.99. The main benefit of this parental control is also its disadvantage. The app allows blocking software activities, but is doesn’t provide any kind of monitoring. That’s why you will not be able to find out what is going on inside of e.g. social networks. Text message communication as well as visited web sources remain a secret for parents.</p>
			<p>As soon as the application is downloaded and installed on the target device, a user can find all required support and assistance right from inside the Kidslox app. You should note that some of those who use this app complain of poor app performance and say that Kidslox very often fails to operate the way it is pointed out.  </p>
            <p>Kidslox can prevent your children from using some particular applications by blocking them. However, there is nothing more available in the app for reliable security and all-round control.</p>

                <p>Techno-Parental Control will allows you lock down your children’s devices remotely previously having warned them about it. For this purpose, the app features a secure website from where parents can send their warning alerts. The website is easily accessible from any Internet connected device.</p>
				<p>Parental controls provided by the app let parents apply complete lock down of the target device. It means that you will be able to motivate your children do their homework or arrange other home affairs without any confrontation. Such option will also be useful to prevent kids from using their smartphones and tablets at school. You can actually use Techno-Parental Control any time you consider that device use is inappropriate.</p>
				<p>With Techno-Parental Control, you can set time limits on the target device to prevent your kids from using at some particular period. For example, you can set your limit from 9 pm to 9 am to not let your little one use his or her smartphone at bedtime. This option can be repeated automatically, so you will not need to set this particular restriction each time. In addition, you can unlock your restriction immediately remotely and at any time you need.</p>
				<p>Techno-Parental Control costs $1.62. Meanwhile, its users admit that the app lacks many important features. Sure, you can use all this limits and lock down the target device. However, such kind of parental control is no different from taking your kid’s device away or putting a password on it.</p>

			<p>This application is designed to make a parent’s smartphone or tablet safe for children. With help of Kids Shell, you can create a safe environment by selecting application that your kids are allowed to run on you device. Thus, your kid will not be able to call anyone, write a text message or open any app other than those approved.</p>
			<p>By using Kid’s Shell, you can gather all application your children like in one secure place. He or she will not be able to click on ads and make in-app purchases. There is no opportunity for a kid to leave a shell, so you can rest assured that your restrictions work. The app is protected with a password for this purpose.</p>
			<p>The app is free to install. However, the use of more extended features will cost you some extra money. In the PRO-version of Kid’s Shell, you will find a possibility to change wallpapers on the desktop, a built-in media player to let your child watch video from your device, an option to block incoming calls or allow them, timer control to specify limited periods for kids on your device. You will also be able to create separate folders and arrange everything, specify the number of workspaces, set quick-call contacts just in case, add widgets, and block Internet access.</p>
			<p>Kid’s Shell seems to be really cool and easy-to-use, but its operation is far from comprehensive security. There are too many apps lacking that you can find in the table at the top of the page. Only all-round monitoring can ensure that your children are safe.</p>

                <p>In the whole market of parental monitoring apps My Mobile Watchdog is one of the best choices for those parents who want to have a whole number of options the manufacturer’s parental control misses in modern smartphones. This app allows parents monitoring all the activities at child’s phone, including its location track, and calls checks.</p>
				<p>What is especially convenient about My Mobile Watchdog app is the opportunity to view the whole text messages history including the recently deleted ones and pictures that were sent in them. This helps preventing any sexting that is highly spread among teenagers. About 90% of teenagers have seen pornography on their mobile devices, but the app also allows blocking websites and view browser use history, so that you ensure the child is not getting any unneeded information.</p>
				<p>If you are worried about your child doing dumb things with their phone, of that the device might become a distraction, the blocking option for disabling the use of the whole phone during certain period (like homework time), as well as blocking the use of camera would surely come in handy for you.</p>
				<p>My Mobile Watchdog Android app is recommended by TV, radio and newspaper experts for those parents who care about their children security and wellbeing. It would at the same time protect kid from the external threats like suspicious and dangerous people online, as well as from himself.</p>

			<p>Sometimes the only remedy for a misbehaving app that would ‘eat’ the whole CPU is killing it with a relevant command – unless you have prepared for such emergency beforehand and installed Watchdog for Android.</p>
			<p>Despite the general belief, having a lot of background apps running on the phone does nothing bad to it, unless the apps are actually making something that can be influencing the phone’s performance speed and eat the CPU. Moreover, on modern Android devices (and up from the 2.2 version) the kill command influences background apps but they restart immediately.</p>
			<p>The latter is much more damaging to your phone and apps as well – with such a harsh interrupt of the work, you might prevent app from operating properly on your phone. The best idea would be leaving those apps run in the background and you would have a much better experience when you get back to using them.</p>
			<p>Watchdog app is an alternative way for keeping a track of phone apps. It literally monitors the currently running apps and alerts about any of them behaving badly. If it comes to happen, you can then kill this only app without interrupting other.</p>
			<p>Watchdog Android app has some additional features in the paid version, and that is a Blacklist for apps. This includes adding an app you expect to cause troubles into a 24/7 monitoring and set a CPU threshold for it – once the app goes over the % you limited it to, Watchdog would kill it immediately.</p>

You would as well control the apps that are used on your child’s phone, so blocking the distracting ones will not be hard.</p>
			<p>For $29, 95 per year one may get a Premium subscription that also includes extended Free features (you would be able to block SMS and calls rather than just monitoring them) together with new features like Facebook monitoring, location tracking and time limiter that allows you restrict the time when the child can actually use the phone. This one would prevent the device from turning into a distraction.</p>

                <p>Some people say that modern day Internet is a sort of huge dispenser where every bit of information goes, and depending on what you are looking for it might turn to be full of garbage or a source of incredible and useful information. Do you want to be sure your kid would get into the second group of users?</p>
				<p>If you are wondering about what is McAfee Family Protection and how it would help you forget about your kid’s Internet surfing dangers, the answer is simple – it is a high-level Parental Control over your child’s browsing. It basically takes care of all the inappropriate content and websites/webpages that content any information you might not want your child to see.</p>
				<p>Providing specific filters and categories for various websites your kid might come across on the Internet, you may prevent him from seeing any of information and websites that can include content connected to ‘drugs’, ‘gambling’ or other dangers.</p>
				<p>The McAfee Family Protection application works with Stock Browser and Google Chrome, and any other browser downloaded to the prone will be deleted by McAfee itself. Being a Device Admin application, McAfee Family Protection is hard to delete from phone unless you actually want it to be gone.</p>
				<p>Currently the app is compatible with Android from 4.03 and up to 6.0 version. The trial version works for 30 days, which is much longer than other apps would normally work. Be sure to check the free version before you purchase the full one.</p>

                                    <p>“I wanted my kids protected in the best way possible, and that’s why I was looking for a good parental control app for their cell phones. I searched a lot and asked other parents for advice. They offered me different software, but most of them used Pumpic and were satisfied with it. I decided to give Pumpic a try too. And you know what? It is great! You can’t even imagine how many useful utilities a careful parent can find in this one app. With it, my kids are protected, I’m sure. I can see who calls them and writes text messages. I can even control all of their activities on the web remotely. It’s fantastic to have such a helper, especially when you’re far away from home.”</p>

                                    <p>“My college shared a link on Facebook with a review of the best parental control apps for Android. That was an unexpected pleasure as I’d been looking for monitoring for my kid then. I read it and Pumpic attracted my attention among others. First of all the app has a great design. I really liked that it looked good and was very easy-to-use. When I tried a month subscription, I was so happy to see that this app can do anything I need to secure my son on his smartphone. I now monitor his calls, text messages, track his location when I’m not sure where he actually is. And Internet monitoring is a huge benefit. I can prevent him from visiting misgiving websites and seeing adult content. Strongly recommend the app to parents!”</p>

                                    <p>“If you are looking for a reliable parental tracking app, you are on the right track. Pumpic is a very helpful application. I work every day and sometimes come back home late. My son stays home alone and no one knows what kind of activities he is engaged in, when I’m not near. With Pumpic I can see it all and control it all. I know where he goes and where he’s been to. I can see every webpage he visits and control each word he types in. I’m sure he won’t get in trouble nor hang out with a bad company. Pumpic is a good opportunity for me to work hard and succeed in parenting. Sure such an app won’t replace you as a mother, but it will keep your child safe. What else could you ask for?!”</p>
