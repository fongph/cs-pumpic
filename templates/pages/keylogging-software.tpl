        <p>Children learn from not only their parents and schoolteachers. The majority of information they get, comes from the surrounding. That’s why to protect your kids from ambiguous knowledge, it is essential to follow their time spent online and filter incoming data.</p> 
        <ul>
		    <li>65% of all information children learn comes from the surrounding</li>
            <li>33% of teens have experienced threats online </li>
            <li>1 in 3 children reports about the abuse to a trusted adult</li>
		</ul>
        <p>More often than not kids tend to keep their private life secret from their parents. It means that if danger comes, there is a chance that you will not even know about it. Parental control software helps your monitor your children’s activity, when you are not nearby. It will secure your kid and avert danger.</p>

    blockBg='light'}
    <p>When it comes to keylogger software, parents usually get confused due to the obscurity of this function. Let’s shed some light on it to make everything fall into place, where it belongs.</p> 
<p>When we talk about keylogger, we at the same time mean a keyboard tracker – a special program developed to capture button presses. With its help, a user can view personal text messages, passwords, credit card numbers, and literally everything that the owner of the target device types in.</p> 
<p>Thus, a keylogger app can help you monitor each tap on a touchscreen and every button your kid hits, while using his or her cell phone. With Pumpic keylogger at your command, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control if your kids use dirty language or any other words inappropriate for children;</li>
<li>Follow all publications they make online and track their communication;</li>
<li>View passwords they set, and change them if the situation requires;</li>
<li>Monitor all suspicious text messages to prevent inherent dangers or threats;</li>
<li>Avert cyberbullying and contacts with online predators.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Such option as a keylogger allows providing your loved ones with all-round protection and preventing any possible danger, that modern world bears.</p>
