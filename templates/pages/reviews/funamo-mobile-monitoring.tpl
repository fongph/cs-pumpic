                                The app is cheap enough and allows you to monitor major cell phone activities like calls and text messages, track location, view websites, block or limit application use.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="media-heading">Cons</h4>
                            <p>
                                Funamo will not let you follow social networks and multimedia files (photos and videos). It doesn’t support keystrokes tracking nor blocking incoming calls by phone numbers.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="media-heading">The Verdict – 5.6/10</h4>
                            <p>
                                The application is cheaper than most of its competitors and its utility is of the same value. If you want to save on your kids’ protection, Funamo is probably your choice. However, note that children safety is priceless.

                    <h3 class="heading">Summary</h3>
                    <p>Funamo is no different from most of parental control apps you can find online. It tracks incoming and outgoing calls, text messages, and location. In addition, it will let you view visited websites, block or limit applications from the list of downloaded ones.</p>
					<p>However, such range of features is poor enough to provide children with appropriate security. As you know, a great majority of dangers that kids face come from the Internet, especially social media. Funamo doesn’t log this kind of online activity, which is a huge lack, when it comes to all-round protection, online predators, and cyberbullying issues.</p>
                    <div class="box-graph">
                        <img src="{$img}/diagrams/chart/04-pumpic-review-funamo-min.png" height="368" width="690" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="heading">Reports & Logs – <span class="heading-rating">3.5/10</span></h3>
                    <p>The application monitors incoming and outgoing calls, as well as sent and received SMS. It will also enable you to track GPS location and set geo-fences to find out once your child leaves or enters specific areas on the map. In addition, Funamo allows viewing visited websites, contact and application lists.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, the parental control app lacks too many useful options. There is no possibility to follow emails, and thus, you will not know about your kid’s subscriptions. The app doesn’t log photos and videos, and you will not be able to prevent your kid from 18+ content. It’s needless to say that social networks are the main source of threats and harassment. Funamo will not let you follow any of them.</p>
                    <h3 class="heading">Limits & Restrictions – <span class="heading-rating">5/10</span></h3>
                    <p>When it comes to controlling smartphone or tablet activities, it is very important to be able to limit or block the use of applications and websites. Funamo will provide you with such a possibility.</p>
					<p>However, you will not be able to restrict phone numbers and prevent your kid from being reached by misgiving people, filter words and phrases to ban threats and explicit language, nor limit the amount of text messages sent daily. </p>
                    <h3 class="heading">Security & Management – <span class="heading-rating">2.5/10</span></h3>
                    <p>Funamo provides its customers with capability of managing the app use and monitoring remotely. It means that you will be able to access your personal account from any computer or mobile gadget and see the entire information on your kid’s cell phone activities from anywhere.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, the app will not notify you of a SIM card change. It will not let you wipe or lock the target device distantly, which means that you will not be able to protect personal data, in case a mobile phone is lost or stolen.</p>
					<h3 class="heading">Help & Support – <span class="heading-rating">2/10</span></h3>
                    <p>To contact Funamo concerning questions that may appear while using the app, you as a client should sent a request over email by filling in a contact form provided on the official website.</p>
					<p>There is no other way to contact Funamo to get customer support or assistance.    </p>
                    <h3 class="heading">Conclusion – <span class="heading-rating">5.6/10</span></h3>
                    <p>Funamo is a cheap solution. It is cheap all along the line. If you want to save money and pretend that you protect your children, try the app. However, don’t expect a lot from it, and don’t complain we didn’t tell you that safety is priceless. </p>
