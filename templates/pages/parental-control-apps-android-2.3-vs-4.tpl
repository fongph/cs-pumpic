                <p>Android 2.3 and further versions up to 2.3.7 are known as Android Gingerbread. This OS version was released back in December 2010 and is currently discontinued. In addition to other innovations of that time, Gingerbread introduced near field communication (NFC) that allowed establishing radio data connection between mobile devices by bringing them closer at a distance of 4 in (10 cm) from each other.</p>
				<p>The vast majority of the modern apps are compatible with old OS versions including the aforementioned Gingerbread (2.3 – 2.3.7) and following Honeycomb (3.0 – 3.2.6). Pumpic is a good example here. Its compatibility covers a wide range of OS versions starting from Android Froyo (2.2 and 2.2.3) up to Android Lollipop (5.0 – 5.1.1), Marshmallow (6.0+), and further. Developers of the app keep improving the software making it up-to-date with each new Android upgrade.</p>
				<p>Though parental monitoring can be applied on <a class="a-default" href="/android-parental-monitoring/">devices with old Android OS</a>, it is recommended to not keep the target smartphone or tablet with abandonware. Since Android developers do not support it, such OS cannot provide you with all those opportunities that up-to-date versions have.</p>
				<p>At the same time, it is important to add that Pumpic does its best to provide its clients, who use devices with old Android OS and cannot afford buying new ones, with the same reliable security and accurate monitoring. But if your target device is modern enough to run new OS, it would be reasonable to update it to Lollipop or at least Android Ice Cream Sandwich for parental controls to operate better, faster, and smoother.</p>

            <h2>Parental Controls on Android 4.0 and Newer</h2>
            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <img class="img-align-left" alt="Android 4.0 Parental Controls" src="{$img}/landings/parental-control-apps-android-4-text.png" width="207px" height="208px" />
                <p>Android OS starting from 4.0 is represented by the following tasty versions: Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0 – 4.0.4), Jelly Bean (4.1 – 4.3.1), KitKat (4.4 – 4.4.4, 4.4W – 4.4W.2), Lollipop (5.0 – 5.1.1), and the latest Marshmallow (6.0 – 6.0.1). These new solutions introduced prominent changes in design, larger performance capacities, and user-friendly interface.</p>
				<p>Unlike Android 3.0 Honeycomb released as tablet-only, 4.0 and newer Android versions were created as a uniform solution for both smartphone and tablets. Thus, <a class="a-default" href="/android-tablet-parental-control.html" target="_blank">Android tablet parental control</a> as well as monitoring for smartphones could be realized on one effective platform.</p>
				<p>Talking about parental controls for Android 4.1 and up, there are many applications online today supporting new OS versions. When choosing the one to use for your children’s safety it is important to pay attention to features provided and frequency of updates.</p>
				<p>Android developers upgrade their software very often. You will probably want to stay up-to-date and boost your Android device according to new available innovations. However, if you use parental controls running on Android 4.2 only or more recent Android KitKat parental controls, meanwhile, further upgrades seem unlikely to be provided in future, it would be better for you to pass on such software. As soon as the target device is updated to a version newer than supported by your parental app, the monitoring process will stop.</p>
				<p>Pumpic provides its clients with upgrades shortly following the official Android release. Thus, you may be sure that your gadget will not get out of date. In some cases, if new OS versions come with bugs yet to be fixed, the developers may wait until a more advanced version is out for clients to use software of the highest possible quality. That’s why it is not recommended to hurry up updating the target device to the recent Android, until all glitches are fixed.</p>
				<p>Pumpic always informs its clients when it is reasonable to apply software upgrade for both the operating system of the target device and the monitoring app itself.</p>
