	<p>The time children spend online staring at a tablet grows each year. As reported by The Guardian, surfing the Internet now even dominates over watching the TV, which has always been a favorite ‘toy’ of any kid for fun and entertainment. However, besides spending at least 3 hours a day with their gadgets in hands, children yet to abandon the television and take their time watching it on average 2 hours daily. If you put this figures together, you will see as many as 5 hours every day – the time wasted for doing nothing without any usefulness, but harm. What is the way out, you may wonder?</p>
	<p>According to Pew Research Center, 39% of parents find the way out in tablets with parental controls. As soon as a monitoring app is installed on your kid’s device, you have an opportunity to keep track of all activities and time on a device. Moreover, reliable parental control software for an Android tablet, and Pumpic is a sound example here, lets you not only watch what your children are doing on their gadgets, but also intervene and set restrictions to prevent what is not allowed.</p>
