        <p class="text-center f-light">Cyberbullying, sexting, and child abuse are online reality our children live in these days. Most parents cannot realize dangers of the Internet, since they simply had no chance to face anything alike in their childhood. Thus, it’s hard to understand what it means to be a teenager connected online 24/7. However, online danger do exists and sometimes it takes away kids’ lives.</p>

                    <li>13 year-old Megan Meier struggled with attention deficit disorder and had issues with her weight. She hanged herself after one of her best Facebook friends said he didn’t want to be friends anymore and messaged “The world would be a better place without you.”</li>

                <p>Most children take the online reality too seriously. They consider it is their true life, have many friends, communicate, and spend most time on the web. Parents should also consider this and keep kids safe online the same way they do in the offline world. Nothing but constant parental control can prevent our loved once from incautious actions.</p>

                <p>Online safety in the USA is crucial and the government is deeply involved in the issue. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) stand on guard of child Internet safety regulating main principles and restrictions of online access for the underage.</p>
                <p>Thus, there allowed to be no 18+ content advertised on kid related web sources as well as data collection restrictions are specified, when it comes to children. However, as practice shows, the government cannot provide Internet safety for children of each family in the U.S. That's why protecting kids online is the top priority of parents.</p>
