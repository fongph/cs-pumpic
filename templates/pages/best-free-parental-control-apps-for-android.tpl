			<p>Kids Place is parental controls that allow you to create childproof environment on Android smartphones and tablets. The app works as a separate user account, which lets parents specify particular apps and activities kids may use and lock the account with a password. It means that your children will not be able to access any other activities, but those authorized by parents.</p>
			<p>The app can prevent your kids from buying and downloading new applications, receiving incoming calls, and using wireless signals. Kids Place also has built-in options for online content filtering. With it, you can restrict the access to inappropriate photos and video files. Importantly, there is a timer feature in the app that allows parents to control children’s screen time.</p>
			<p>Kids Place parental control is a free app. However, there are some additional premium features, which become available only after an in-app purchase. With a pay version, you will be able to run Kids Place in a background mode, block uninstallation of the app, use an option to always start on reboot, and set a customized title for a home screen.</p>
			<p>Users admit Kids Place as a useful tool for parenting. Though some of them complain of periodical glitches that lock the phone completely, do not allow to exit the app, and cause failure to block some children’s activities. In some cases, it fails to prevent kids from closing Kids Place and passing over its restrictions.</p>
			<p>Kids Place lacks some significant parental control features as well:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>The app doesn’t log phone calls, but only blocks them as such. Thus, if you let your kids talk on the phone you will not be able to find out who called them and whom they called.</li>
			   <li>The same goes for text messages. The app doesn’t let parents view SMS and other texts for inappropriate words, cyberbullying, and sexting.</li>
			   <li>If you let your children use the Internet, you will not be able to monitor and prevent them from dangers. You can either block online access permanently or leave kids unattended.</li>

                <p>Some people don’t think that not letting your child play football with friends until homework is done, is parental control. But it is. The same when you allow your son or daughter play computer games only one or two hours a day. Generally, parental control refers to a set of measures parents use to take care of their kids and prevent them from possible risks they may face every now and then.</p>
				<p>That's exactly what Limitly is about. It is a screen time management app that allows to easily control device or applications usage. Basically, it prevents children from frittering away time with tablets and smartphones. With Limitly, parents are enabled to specify periods or the exact time when their kids can use handheld Android gadgets in general and peculiar applications in particular.</p>
				<p>Limitly - Screen Time Parental Control App provides parents with flexibility to manage their kids' on-screen time thanks to a broad range of features:</p>
				<ul style="margin-left: 200px !important;">
			     <li>Set schedule for specific apps usage;</li>
				   <li>Limit the entire target device usage;</li>
				   <li>Categorize apps by type and control their group limits as one application;</li>
           <li>Automatically apply limits to the apps newly added to Categories;</li>
           <li>Get full reports on which apps and how often your kid uses;</li>
           <li>Customize messages that your child would see before a limit takes action;</li>
           <li>Quarantine recently installed apps until an adult reviews them.</li>
			</ul>
				<p>As today parental control is closely connected to the issue of mobile gadgets use by kids, Limitly can be of great help here. It's especially helpful when parents need to keep their children focused – at school, while doing homework, at bedtime or during family events. Moreover, one shouldn't forget that limiting screen time can have a positive effect on kids' sleep and health.</p>
        {*
        <p>Among Limitly's drawbacks we can mark out the following:</p>
				<ul>
			     <li>The app only supports Android and is not compatible with iOS;</li>
				   <li>Monitoring functionality is limited to reporting on which apps were used on the target device (for the sake of fairness, we must say that Limitly doesn't promote itself as parental monitoring solution, the parental control is the core).</li>

			<p>The Screen Time app is designed for managing children’s time spent on smartphones and tablets. It allows parents to set various restrictions on kids’ devices as well as monitor browsing history and application downloads.</p>
			<p>With this parental control, you will be able to set daily time limits on each application separately, block specific apps at bedtime or while your kids are at school. Thus, you can restrict access to social media so as to prevent your children from using them during their classes.</p>
			<p>A time out feature lets parents block device activities with one single click on their own smartphones or tablets. The app also allows you to reward kids with bonus time on their mobile devices, if they show good task performance or improve their behavior. In addition, the Screen Time app lets review websites your kids visit, applications they download, as well as apps they use most of all.</p>
			<p>The app is meant to be free of charge. However, if you look closer, you will see that everything is not as it seems. When you install Screen Time for the first time, you can use all the features available, which comprises its Premium subscription plan. But after 14 days, you will have only two of them left. The rest will become available for $39.99 per year. Thus, with a free version the Screen Time parental control allows to review web and search history, and monitor one device remotely.</p>
			<p>There are some reasonable disadvantages the app should improve to provide kids with reliable protection:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>Screen Time doesn’t support social media monitoring. You can only block social apps completely. It means you will not be able to protect your kids against cyberbullies and online predators, at times when you allow them to use social networks.</li>
			   <li>There is no opportunity to track cell phone activities. Thus, you will not know who calls your kids. Text messages are also not supported. The app will not let you prevent your children from sexting or at least find out about such a misgivings activity.</li>
			   <li>Some users complain of high prices set by Screen Time Lab. Sure, there is a free version. However, it turns out to be useful after 14 days, which are a free trial of the Premium subscription.</li>

                <p>A parental control application by Norton protects your children from dangers they may come across on the Internet. This software will prevent your kids from accessing inappropriate web content as well as wasting time on their smartphones and tablets.</p>
				<p>The Norton Family Parental Control app comprises some useful features to monitor and secure children’s mobile activities. With it, you can view websites they visit and block you find misgiving. In addition, the app will send you notifications, if your kids decide to enter one of those websites you have blocked.</p>
				<p>Among other childcare opportunities, the app allows tracking location on the map and following text conversations. The Norton parental control also has application management options. Thus, you can view downloaded apps, block timewasting ones, and check the amount of time your children spend with their mobile gadgets in hands.</p>
				<p>A free version of the app means that you can use Norton’s Premier package for 30 days with no charge. However, as soon as this free trial period is over, you will need to make a purchase. Otherwise, your parental control abilities will be limited to web site restriction and alerts.</p>
				<p>Users admit some bugs and glitches appearing in the app after a month of usage. The app starts crashing and fails to support set up restrictions. Moreover, there are some other problems to be fixed:</p>
				<ul>
			       <li>Norton’s web history control works with a limited number of browsers. Thus, it doesn’t support many of them children can download to overcome parents’ restrictions easily.</li>
				   <li>The app can’t monitor children’s activities in the incognito mode of browser. Kids can hide from parents what they are surfing by using this private mode.</li>
				   <li>Doesn’t allow monitoring social media and online chats. All you can do is block these apps. But if you let your kids use one of them you will never know what they do there, and thus, have no opportunity to prevent online risks.</li>

			<p>The Parental Control Board app is designed for child protection, when it comes to cell phone use and online activities. It includes some useful features that will help you find out what your kids are doing on their smartphones and tablets, who calls and texts them, as well as where they are.</p>
			<p>Among the features of the app, you will find location tracking and geo-fencing to prevent your children from visiting restricted areas as and be notified as soon as they leave or enter set up zones on the map. Parental Control Board will also let you view calls logs and text messages. In addition, you can block callers by phone numbers and message senders by keywords.</p>
			<p>An application control feature allows parents to block specific apps and see how much time children spend playing, texting, surfing etc. Meanwhile, with help of a safe browsing mode you will be able to make sure your kids don’t look for inappropriate content on the web.</p>
			<p>An option called Kiosk Mode allows creating a separate user screen for kids with a specified number of apps they can use and phone numbers they can call. </p>
			<p>Users appreciate the app as good one, though some of them complain of many bugs. Thus, location tracking may work inaccurately, some issues with uninstallation appear from time to time, and Kiosk Mode sometimes fails to work. According to users, Parental Control Board crashes very often, though the issue gets solved after another version update.</p>
			<p>The app is meant to be free of charge, but in reality it is only a free trial. A year license for the Android version of Parental Control Board costs $12.</p>
			<p>The Parental Control Board app also has some other problems to be solved to improve reliability:</p>
			<ul>
			   <li>Safe browsing is available only via a specific app called Fire Phoenix. It means that you will need to block all other browsers to prevent your kids from inappropriate search on the web. And keep blocking new ones they may download.</li>
			   <li>Social media monitoring is not supported. Meanwhile, it remains the main source of cyberbullying, online predator attacks, sexting, and other threats kids face on the Internet.</li>
			   <li>Location tracking has doubtful accuracy, which may cause confusion, when it will come to looking for your children on the map and in place.</li>

                <p>The software allows parents to monitor their kids on smartphones and tablets as well as block some mobile activities. It actually comes with two complementary applications: Abeona Parental Control installed on a parent’s device and Abeona Device Monitor installed on a child’s gadget.</p>
				<p>The Abeona app provides parents with an opportunity to view call logs, track location, and set geofences, which notify you with an alert once your children leave or enter specified areas. The app will also show you applications being used currently as well as general time spend on each app. If you see that your kids spend too much time on any of apps you consider inappropriate, you can block them easily thanks to Abeona’s functionality.</p>
				<p>When it comes to Internet use, the app allows parents to find out if their children are online or offline and follow websites they visit via Chrome.</p>
				<p>The app seems to be useful and reliable. However, when start using it, Abeona’s clients point on some reasonable glitches. Thus, in some cases the app doesn’t follow commands. When you try to block an app it may not work. Sometimes the app fails to open at all. Users also admit that children manage to pass over app blocking by repeatedly pressing on its icon.</p>
				<p>In addition, there are some more substantial disadvantages that should be considered:</p>
				<ul>
			       <li>Abeona doesn’t support old Android OS versions. The developers of the app admit it stating that old versions are not supposed to be supported at all due to technical reasons.</li>
				   <li>Location tracking and geo-fences don’t work without Internet connection. Thus, if your children have no Wi-Fi around, you will not be able to find out where they are.</li>
				   <li>The app provides web history monitoring only via the Chrome browser. Meanwhile, your children are free to use other browsers and you will not even know what they are surfing.</li>

He showed me how it worked on his own mobile phone and I was really amazed how many kids’ activities he could actually track. I decided to give it a shot. I use it all the time. I’m very satisfied with the app.”</p>

This age is very dangerous for kids as they start getting more and more from their lives each day and life exposes them to dangers in return. I thought a parental app would be great safety solution. However, I couldn’t find any good one. All Android phone monitoring software free of charge turned out to be useless. Pumpic was and is my solution. It’s worth every dime I’ve spent for it.”</p>

                                    <p>“I came across Pumpic in an online review as the best free Android parental control app. I couldn’t believe that a free app could have so many useful features. And it didn’t. As expected, Pumpic was a pay app. Still, I decided to try it and ordered a month plan. After a month of using it to monitor my son, I decided to prolong my plan for a year. Pumpic provides amazing monitoring. I can check literally everything on my kid’s phone. I’ll keep using it, until my son grows up.”</p>
