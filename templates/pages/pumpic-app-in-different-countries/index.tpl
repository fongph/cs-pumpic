    title="Kids' Mobile Devices Monitoring: A Vital Necessity"
    blockBg='light'}

	<p>Today, technology is taking over the world. And when we say 'technology,' for the vast majority of people it means the Internet and web-related products or services. Indeed, one simply cannot imagine a normal life without the World Wide Web. According to Internetlivestats.com, in 2016, the number of Internet users in the world surpassed 3.5 billion, making it almost half of the Earth population. Little less than one-third of them (around 1 billion) are children aged up to 17 years old. Naturally, kids and teens who are less experienced and more trustful than adults are subject to digital dangers above all others. Another crucial thing parents must be aware of is that almost 100% of children who own a smartphone use it to access the Internet. That's why parental mobile monitoring is not a luxury but a necessity vital to ensure your kid's Internet safety.</p>

        <p>As you can see, the vast majority of parents tend toward using traditional methods like checking a device manually or taking it away. Instead, they should use appropriate monitoring and safety tools to protect their children from modern perils. Like Pumpic.</p>
		<p>Pumpic is a state-of-the-art phone and tablet legal tracking app. Its features help concerned parents secure their kids’ both online and offline. The app’s functionality provides broad device monitoring options so that parents can go far beyond “Turn it off!” request. Pumpic is available for Android and iOS mobile devices; for the latter ones, you can choose a solution with or without jailbreak (works with iCloud). In any form, this parental app will let you detect and avert possible dangers that threaten your little loved ones.</p>
		<p>Pumpic lets parents rise awareness of who contacts their children and for what purpose, what they do online, or where they go. You can keep track of:</p>
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" /><strong>Communications</strong> – calls, SMS, instant messengers;</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" /><strong>Internet activity</strong> – social media, browsing history, bookmarks;</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" /><strong>Location</strong> – current whereabouts, route history, geofences (<i>feature availability restrictions apply</i>);</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/check-icon.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" /><strong>Other data</strong> – contacts, calendar, notes, etc.</li>
				</ul>
		<p>Thus, Pumpic enables parents to notice warning signs of a problem (cyberbullying, sexting, online predator attack, etc.) and take necessary steps to shield their kids. Thanks to keeping parents' eyes open, the app helps them prevent or avert troubles or at least minimize their consequences.</p>

    <p>In different countries, people have different, sometimes even contrasting values. But no matter what part of the world you live in, children are considered to be the most precious treasure. Ensuring their safety is the top priority task for moms and dads around the globe. Pumpic app is not related to any cell phone service provider, so you can take advantage of its protective features literally <strong>worldwide</strong>. Just set the app up on the device you wish to monitor and stay aware wherever you or your kids go. At the same time, we suggest you check the list of countries where Pumpic is most popular.</p>
    <ul class="list-images">
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_usa.png" title="Parental monitoring in the US" alt="Parental apps are very popular in USA" class="lc-3" /><p>The rate of the Internet use by kids and teens in the <strong>US</strong> is one of the highest in the world. Respectively, children's online safety issue is of great importance there. That's why <a class="a-default" href="/parental-monitoring-app-usa.html">parental monitoring and special tracking software in USA</a> are in the limelight of multiple non-profit Internet security or anti-bullying organizations and even the federal government.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_canada.png" title="Parental monitoring in Canada" alt="Parental apps are quite popular in Canada" class="lc-2" /><p><strong>Canada</strong> has much lower crime rate and higher societal tolerance compared to the US. But when it comes to kid's online security the picture is not that merciful. Arguably, the most well-known case of cyberbullying that resulted in a suicide happened in British Columbia with a 15 y.o. Amanda Todd. Since then, <a class="a-default" href="/parental-monitoring-app-canada.html">averting digital dangers with the help of parental apps is a burning topic in Canada</a>.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_brazil.png" title="Parental monitoring in Brazil" alt="Parental apps are very popular in Brazil" class="lc-2" /><p>In <strong>Brazil</strong>, the largest country in South America, three-quarters of children aged 10-15 regularly go online. The dispute over who and how should monitor their Internet use – schools or parents – is only kicking into gear. That's why <a class="a-default" href="/espiao-movel.html">parental monitoring tools in Brazil</a> are only gaining popularity while the majority of parents use traditional practices like taking the device away from a kid.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_australia.png" title="Parental monitoring in Australia" alt="Parental apps are well-known in Australia" class="lc-2" /><p>On the other side of the globe, in <strong>Australia</strong>, a cyberbullying topic often grabs the headlines. Sadly, this mostly happens on bitter occasions like when inadequate online behavior causes suicidal cases among teens. Thankfully, due to civic and governmental campaigns, parents are well-informed about <a class="a-default" href="/parental-monitoring-app-australia.html">parental software and monitoring apps available in Australia</a>.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_uk.png" title="Parental monitoring in the UK" alt="Parental apps in Great Britain are very widespread" class="lc-2" /><p>In Europe, <strong>Great Britain</strong> is one of few countries that on the national level strongly promote safe Internet practices and encourage parents to use specialized software tailored to these needs. Alongside with the governmental initiatives, much good is done by non-commercial organizations like Anti-Bullying Alliance. No wonder, <a class="a-default" href="/parental-monitoring-app-uk.html">apps for parental monitoring are quite widespread in the UK</a>.</p></li>
        <li><img src="{$img}/list/pumpic-app-in-different-countries_germany.png" title="Parental monitoring in Germany" alt="Parental apps are very popular in Germany" class="lc-2" /><p>In <strong>Germany</strong>, authorities pay serious attention to buffer the negative impact of the Internet use by kids and teens. They've conducted several surveys that showed that parental monitoring has a critical effect on cyberbullying and significantly decreases the risk of children becoming victims of online predators. Hence, <a class="a-default" href="/mobile-spion.html">mobile monitoring software is a trend in Germany</a> today.</p></li>
    </ul>
	<p>Fighting multiple Internet-related dangers is nowadays a global issue as the online perils do not recognize any borders or jurisdictions. Educating parents and their kids on the problems of web safety is one of the most effective ways to prevent bad things from happening to our loved ones. Another component of successful opposition by parents to digital threats is staying aware of what is going on in their kids' lives even when they are not around. Pumpic is proud to contribute to this noble effort.</p>
