	<p>At the root of every discussion about the smartphone privacy is the fact that you often have to give out your number. When it's revealed, it can be purchased and resold many times. Have you ever wondered why different online resources ask you to leave your phone number? Usually they convince you that these are the issues of security process, but don't trust them! Most websites use your number for their tricky purposes and then sell it to different marketing and research firms. Shocked? No doubt, you are! Just think, according to the Pew Research Center, about 90% of Americans own a cell phone. And surely all of them are a possible target for getting income.</p>
	<p>Adults understand how to behave themselves with people who call them and offer different services or ask questions. Unfortunately, children don't realise the danger and can tell private details to strangers. Today more and more people look for the ways to limit access to such data and search for app to block calls on Android and iOS devices. But finding the path to block calls can be digging. Some old devices don't have the native blocking function. Thankfully, there is a great way to block calls on your kid's device with the help of installing parental control app.</p>

            <div class="pt30 pb20">
                <p>Smartphone usage today turns into uncontrolled behaviour. Children spend a lot of time in the Internet and as a result are exposed to different online dangers. They don't have enough knowledge and experience to notice a potential risk, that's why your duty as a careful parent is to protect your kid. We'll reveal just a few data prepared by the Paw Research Center that will surely persuade you to take this issue seriously.</p>
                <p>About 85% of youth use smartphones on a regular basis making it a common medium of cyberbullying. 50% of teens have experienced it, and only 2% tell parents that they are the victims of cyberbullying. Do you know that cyberbullying is among the top reasons of teens' suicide?</p>
                <p>This serious problem of violence and harm can be easily resolved by using parental control apps like Pumpic. Here are the main factors why you won't regret installing it.</p>
