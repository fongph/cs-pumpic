                            <p>Kik Messenger is a popular app that allows to connect with friends, groups and the world
                                via chat. It has approximately 240 million registered users and is used by 40 per cent
                                of teenagers in the United States. It lets users send and receive messages, share
                                pictures and videos, mobile webpages and different types of content.</p>
                            <p>What makes this app so popular among teens is that it doesn’t require providing telephone
                                number and any other information apart from the username. This feature of preserving
                                anonymity attracts youth, however, has downsides for safety and privacy. That’s why
                                teens using this social networking app will need safety guidance. And you, as a careful
                                parent, should provide it to protect your children from all possible online risks and
                                dangers.</p>

                            <p>One of the most reliable ways to keep your child safe is to monitor Kik app with the help
                                of parental control, such as Pumpic. Most kids don’t realize the danger that comes with
                                oversharing information online, and if not used properly, Kik messenger provides

                                abuse. Thus, monitoring Kik messages with the help of parental controls is inevitable.
                            </p>
