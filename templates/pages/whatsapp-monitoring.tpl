			<p>Most dangers teenagers face today are closely connected with the mobile devices usage and unlimited online experience. If you want to monitor WhatsApp chat or any other activity on your kid’s smartphone, install parenting control app, like Pumpic. With the tracking software assistance, you’ll be confident that your child is safe round-the-clock.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are three persuasive reasons to install parental controls:</strong></p>    
				<ul class="list-images">
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />They are multifunctional – monitoring software has a lot of various functions and features to ensure the best protection. You can not only monitor WhatsApp messages on iPhone and Android, but also track location, check the calls, browsing history, oversee Facebook and Twitter experience, and much more.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />They are easy to use – you should install the application once and then get the most of it while you want to stop tracking your child’s device.</li>
				<li><img src="/images/landings/mark.png" alt="Check Mark" style="left: -30px;" />They are legal – is it absolutely lawful to use parental control to monitor the child’s device. As they are allowed for usage, you’ll have no problems with downloading and installing them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Monitoring software allows to keep your little darlings from all online dangers. According to the Pew Research Center, 51% of teens who use the Internet were cyberbullied. Parental controls will help you save your child from undesirable practice of communicating with strangers or being offended or harmed by peers.</p>
