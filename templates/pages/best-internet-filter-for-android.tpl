    blockBg='light'}
	
	<p>The World Wide Web is an infinite source of information, wisdom and fun. It also is a great environment to meet new people and find folks to share your interests. But at the same time, the Internet is a breeding ground for tons of inappropriate content and dozens of hidden dangers. Many of them threaten the most vulnerable group of Internet users – the kids.</p>
	<p>Add the fact that nowadays 91 percent of teenagers (13 to 17 years old) access the Internet via various mobile devices - smartphones, tablets and other gadgets. This makes monitoring and controlling what kids view online even more difficult. Thus, they become exposed to the apparent and hidden Internet dangers – from cyberbullying to sexual content, from gambling to online predators. That is why a concerned parent can hardly be too careful when it comes to letting the child surf the Net these days.</p>

	    <p class="text-center f-light">Android-based smartphones and tablets are incredibly popular as a child’s first mobile device: they are relatively cheap, come in a huge variety of shapes and colors, and there is an enormous number of different free and paid apps in Google Play to fit any taste. The pitfall of handing Android device to a kid is its weak parental controls, which – unlike iOS on Apple products – have very limited functionality. That’s why third-party solutions are often not a whim but a must.</p>
		<p class="text-center f-light">So before introducing your kid to the newly purchased Android gadget, make sure it is family-friendly ready and safety-enabled. Read about potential online risks, review the best Internet filtering options for Android, and choose the most efficient way to prevent your little ones from facing them. Regarding content restriction, you can select to install a separate Internet filter or a comprehensive parental control software.</p>

                        <p>Usually, Internet filtering tool can “clean up” the Internet for kids by restricting access to the websites with explicit material. Often based on the child’s age presets, it automatically blocks porn sites, allows keyword filtering as well as adding specific web pages to the blacklist. Some of them are able to mask obscene language instead of blocking the whole page. Another approach is to create a list of trusted websites and let user visit pages only from this whitelist. That’s basically all that Internet filters can do.</p>
